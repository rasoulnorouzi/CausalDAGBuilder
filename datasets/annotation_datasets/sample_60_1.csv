"There is a dilemma because on the one hand, entering information to a shared database causes individual costs: A contributor has to expend time and effort writing down the information and may lose some individual influence (as knowledge in organizations often is regarded as a kind of power)."
"The consistent disagreement patterns yield similar results, but the variations in rate of attributing principle as a reason are not significant, perhaps because of the greater consensus in the reasons given for these patterns (see Table 3 )"
"We use credit more, increasing our short-term gain, but costing us more in the long term."
"More precisely, De Kwaadsteniet et al. (2007) showed in a common resource dilemma that when tacit coordination was difficult to achieve (because the size of the resource was uncertain) harvesting behavior became more self interested except for the condition where group members were held accountable."
"Following from this reasoning, it could be expected that accountability influences cooperation in such a way that if one's choices are not anonymous toward the others, cooperation levels will be higher than if one's choices are anonymous."
"Moreover, the persistence (duration) of the initial choice of OTHER also affected rates of cooperation."
"We accept that social capital may be a broad and perhaps even rather fuzzy concept, and define social capital as norms that enhance the incentive compatibility of non-contractual or legally enforceable exchange."
Our model also departs from BCS by incorporating conditional cooperation to allow the collective identity prime to influence decision making through its impact on beliefs about others choices (see Chaudhuri 2011 for a survey of conditional cooperation in public goods provision in the lab).
"Although on average both types of subjects overcontribute with respect to their Nash contribution, over contribution is significant only for poor subjects."
"We found that social ties were developed during the public good game, and the value of the ties depended on the success of the interaction."
"Our experimental subjects were surprisingly successful in peer monitoring, eschewing the opportunity to use a specialist monitor almost every time they chose between the two options in treatments where monitoring was equally costly to both peers and observer."
so that relatively large deviations from the predicted decision result in relatively small reductions in expected payoff.
"Of course, as every student of statistics learns, extreme sample statistics are more common in smaller samples."
Looking at the average of the results of these decisions could mask important variations and patterns within the data.
"In contrast, resource sharing may entail joint decisions by the involved agents, i.e., strategic decision making; evidently, the issue of costs here is of higher importance as compared to the typically small-scale costs of help."
"Thus, a limited public resource, which everyone is free to use, e.g. the global climate, unmanaged fish stock in common fishing grounds, or hygiene in highly anonymous public places such as train stations, is usually not sustained."
The amount of responsiveness we find in second period contributions is not enough by itself to induce selfish players to contribute in the first period.
The two responsibly punishing agents (R) are not enough to induce Opportunistic (O) agents to contribute because there are also two Anti-Social Punishing (A) agents.
"The motivation for collective action results from bidding wars, based on actors' locations in social structures."
"If we observe that in a MCS treatment groups contribute a lower (higher) percentage of their freely disposable endowments (net endowments) than the groups in the NoMin treatment, we interpret this observation as motivational crowding-out (crowding-in) of contributions by the minimum contribution requirements."
"Moreover, people respond more negatively when over-included in a negative situation than when included in a negative situation (Van Beest & Williams, 2006)."
"However, as we tested various models, we may suggest a causal path because only the model with a double mediation in between peer rejection and antisocial media preferences was significant."
"Ones need to belong, for instance, or ones attachment style might very well moderate either upward or downward ones reaction to interpersonal rejection."
It was hypothesized that ostracised individuals would report lower mood and self-esteem when compared with included individuals.
"Also, similar to adults, social connection related activities may decrease the likelihood of negative, dysregulated responses after ostracism among young adolescents."
"For the physical self-control task, men persisted longer as did those who had stronger baseline hand strength."
Our findings are also consistent with evidence that belonging is valued even from undesirable groups.
"Moreover, ostracized participants also reported feeling angrier and enjoyed the game less than included participants."
The previous adverse experiences might additionally explain why some persons react to stress with a decrease in self-esteem and a subsequent increase in paranoid ideation while others do not.
It is also consistent with the finding by Barrowclough et al. (2003) that criticism impacts indirectly on the positive symptoms of psychosis through negative self evaluations
Being socially excluded seems to be a direct cause of reduction in the sense of life as meaningful.
"Therefore, it is unlikely the aggression was tempered due to fear of retaliation."
"For example, anger is associated with the desire to move against another person or obstacle by fighting or harming it (Frijda, Kuipers, & ter Schure, 1989; Roseman, Wiest, & Swartz, 1994), whereas sadness is associated with helplessness (Frijda et al., 1989)."
"Merely observing another individuals ostracism is enough to cause distress to the observer (Wesselmann, Bagg, & Williams, 2009)."
"However, in the current studies, self-esteem did not decrease following the ostracism manipulation, and self-esteem did not increase following the discrimination tasks."
"Thus, when others are aware of the rejected individuals reactions, they should avoid responding aggressively to the rejection."
"We additionally predicted that increasing belonging needs would, in turn, be related to an increased desire to listen to emotional, but not descriptive, disclosure."
We also found that socially included participants given OT reported an increased desire to play the game again with the virtual participants.
"One possible mechanism moderating the relationship between ostracism and food intake is emotional distress, as research has shown that both positive and negative mood increase eating compared to neutral mood (Patel & Schlundt, 2001) and studies suggest that obese individuals are more likely to overeat in response to emotional reactions (Greeno & Wing, 1994; Wing, Blair, Epstein, & McDermott, 1990)."
"Nevertheless, we cannot know from the present results whether feelings of anger evoked by other sources, or other emotions such as anxiety, may affect moral judgment and media preferences in a similar way."
"Several participants also said that, while they were aware of the risks to confidentiality when they agreed to participate in a study, the risks were not significant enough to deter them from participating in research."
"The main criticism against rapid data collection procedures in ethnography is that not enough time is spent in the field to collect quality in-depth data (Spradley, 1980) where a range of activities and practices can be observed allowing a researcher to interpret values, norms and other cultural and social practices (Watson, 2011)."
Erm I would say more passive because I have experience (.) does not necessarily mean Ive done actively something about it.
"When asked about secondary-use concerns, participants expressed worry that secondary users of qualitative data could misinterpret, misuse, or be biased when handling their data (the code was applied in 16/30 interviews)."
"If findings hinge on frequency counts, there is a strong argument that IRR should be used."
(HREC 7) One HREC member noted that obtaining informed consent is more complex when research is being conducted via the internet particularly when it involves consent to use publically available social media content: Even if informed consent can be obtained (from the participant)
It was generally agreed that active participation is necessary in order to fulfill the ethical requisite that research be of use to the community being studied (also known as beneficence)
"Prominent examples include those who live in informal arrangements outside of public record (slum residents or undocumented immigrants), those who are rarely at home (domestic help or miners), and those whose homes are spatially dispersed and interspersed with non-target populations (street vendors)."
Some participants were also concerned about the subsequent use of the findings and about excessive emphasis on the connection with non-academic partners; some were clear that they did not support the view that every project needs to demonstrate such links.
"However, despite the rise of a number of critical and poststructural ways of knowing, it remains that most epistemological paradigms that engage qualitative research acknowledge that while knowledge is not objective, scientific validity is an ideal to strive toward (Caretta & Riano, 2016, p. 259, emphasis in original)."
"This finding shows that there is a strong correlation between what consumers say (frequency of mention) and what they like the most about the ideas generated (importance), thus confirming what Guerrero et al."
"However, novice qualitative researchers are often afraid to conceptualise and risk interpreting and moving their analysis beyond the descriptive level."
"Editors commonly expressed a desire to work towards agreements, even with the acknowledgment that PDA policies might not rapidly change alongside these consensus agreements: I think what wed like to be doing more is working with the community to define what the data sharing expectations are in individual sub fields and disciplines and for different specific data types."
"As discussed further below, think-aloud dialogue during card-sort activities can produce an additional research data point, adding a new depth to a study, wherein participants stream of consciousness dialogue enrich their card-sort results."
"Despite the inherent subjectivity of qualitative research, emphasis was placed on making the data collection as well as the data analysis and interpretation of results transparent and inter subjectively verifiable."
"This enabled us to test and strengthen the protocol, and it also helped all co-authors to recognise that this flexible and context-driven approach to anonymising was a complex, time-consuming, and skilled process."
"We also facilitate an atmosphere in which students are aware that professional support, including networking advice, job, and graduate school application preparation, and letters of recommendation are benefits to joining a coding team."
"Table 3 Opportunities and difficulties of open research data identified in the interviews Opportunities Challenges Clearer decision making Globalization and cooperation across borders Comparative studies can be done nationally and internationally Jurisprudence, ethical and commercial interests can affect whether the data could be made open access (sensitive data)"
"Particularly for insider researchers, the position of the researcher in relation to participants is inextricably linked to the construction of reality (Greene, 2014), given that a relationship already exists outside the theatre of qualitative research."
"However, our qualitative results show that the presence of a scientific expert had subtle influences on the ways that stakeholders discussed sensitive topics, particularly in placing emphasis on their own credibility and knowledge."
