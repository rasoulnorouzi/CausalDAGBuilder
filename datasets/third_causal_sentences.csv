/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/1-s2.0-S0022103103001823-main.pdf,"thus, once again, it appears that ostracism, per se, is felt immediately as a negative and depleting experience."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/1-s2.0-S0022103103001823-main.pdf,it appears that ostracism is such a powerful signal that even being ignored by a computer can activate strong reactions.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/1-s2.0-S0022103103001823-main.pdf,"indeed, eisenberger, lieberman, and williams (2003) showed activation of the anterior cingulate cortex-the brain region that is also activated when individuals endure physical pain-as a result of cyberball ostracism, even when the participants were told their particular computer was not yet linked to the other two participants computers."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/1-s2.0-S0022103103001823-main.pdf,"the amassed evidence suggests that at all levels of measurement, humans detect and suffer from the most minimal cues of ostracism, supporting our view that ostracism is such a powerful social signal that it produces widespread intrapsychic reactions that serve to mobilize coping responses (see also, panksepp, 2003)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/1-s2.0-S0191886912002218-main.pdf,previous research has found ostracism's immediate effects robust to moderation by individual differences.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/1-s2.0-S0191886912002218-main.pdf,"however, this could be the result of using retrospective measures taken after the ostracism occurs, rather than assessing the effects of ostracism throughout the episode."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/1-s2.0-S0191886912002218-main.pdf,individual differences in loneliness and social avoidance and distress moderated affective reactions throughout ostracism and inclusion.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/1-s2.0-S0191886912002218-main.pdf,"lonely individuals, compared to less-lonely individuals, had slower affect decrease when ostracized but quicker affective increase when included."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/1-s2.0-S0191886912002218-main.pdf,"ostracism is experienced neurologically as pain (eisenberger, lieberman, & williams, 2003), and hurts even when being ostracized by a hated outgroup (gonsalkorale & williams, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/1-s2.0-S0191886912002218-main.pdf,williams (2009) argues that humans evolved to detect the slightest cues of ostracism and experience immediate discomfort.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/1-s2.0-S0191886912002218-main.pdf,the difficulty researchers previously had finding moderation may lead them to conclude that individual differences do not moderate initial reactions to ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/1-s2.0-S0191886912002218-main.pdf,might it be the case that individual differences moderate ostracism's effects during the course of the ostracism episode but have little effect on individuals at the end of the episode?

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/1-s2.0-S0191886912002218-main.pdf,this approach may limit researchers from understanding the complex ways in which individual differences moderate ostracism's immediate effects.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/1-s2.0-S0191886912002218-main.pdf,"these individual differences may moderate the overall magnitude of ostracism's effects, the speed at which participants are affected by ostracism, and the speed of recovery."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/1-s2.0-S0191886912002218-main.pdf,these studies suggest that lonely individuals should show more affective decline to ostracism over time than non-lonely participants because of their hypersensitivity to exclusion relevant cues.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/1-s2.0-S0191886912002218-main.pdf,lonely participants should also respond more positively to inclusion over time than non-lonely participants because their hunger for human connection is being satisfied.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/1-s2.0-S0191886912002218-main.pdf,"one possibility is that individuals high in this construct, compared with those who are low, would be affected less negatively by ostracism because they already have a preference for avoiding others (similar to cluster a personality disorder, see wirth, lynam, et al., 2010)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/1-s2.0-S0022103112000273-main.pdf,"future studies should, however, examine more directly whether ingroup exclusion indeed results in more self uncertainty than outgroup exclusion, and whether this may explain why people become more attracted to fundamentalist religious beliefs."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/30840.pdf,"introduction although people have many essential physical and psychological needs, the need for social belonging is high in motivational priority (e.g., baumeister & leary, 1995; kenrick, griskevicius, neuberg, & schaller, 2010)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/30840.pdf,"when this need is thwarted through social exclusion, rejection, or ostracism, people self-report lowered feelings of belonging, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence, as well as exhibit marked changes in behavior ranging from increased aggression to increased pursuit of social affiliation (e.g., williams, 2007a)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/30840.pdf,"in this paper we reveal that the temporal framing, or phrasing, of these self-report measures shapes people's responses."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/30840.pdf,"in fact, personality factors have been found to moderate responses to social exclusion when affect is measured during ostracism instead of retrospectively wesselmann, wirth, mroczeka, & williams, 2012.)"
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/30840.pdf,williams posits that reactions to exclusion in the reflective stage are moderated by personality and the circumstances surrounding the exclusion.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/30840.pdf,"because he believes people quickly move from the reflexive stage to the reflective stage, williams argues that self-report measures of personal distress (e.g., lowered basic needs) should be phrased in the past tense to capture how participants felt when they were still in the painful reflexive stage."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/30840.pdf,he writes: this distinction becomes important because the available evidence suggests that the reflexive pain/distress signal is quickly followed by appraisals and coping mechanisms that direct the individual toward thoughts and feelings that alleviate the pain.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/30840.pdf,"williams, 2007a, p. 432] in other words, if participants report less distress when asked in the present tense than in the past, it is because the coping and appraisal processes of the reflective stage have reduced their distress."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/30840.pdf,"but what if framing self-report measures in the present tense does not merely reduce excluded participant's distress, but eliminates the effect of rejection altogether?"
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/30840.pdf,"if there is a null effect of exclusion on self-reported present distress when feelings are reported immediately after the experience, to comport with williams' temporal theory this would require that recovery from exclusion is near instantaneous a conclusion that contradicts the results of other research."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/30840.pdf,several experiments support the claim that individuals still exhibit strong responses to social exclusion shortly after the ostracism experience.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/1-s2.0-S0022103105001290-main.pdf,that this threat interpretation was associated with lower rates of recovery of the primary needs suggests some support for the theory that high socially anxious people possess a biased cognitive style-one that maintains the deleterious evects of ostracism and thereby potentially prohibits active coping.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf35.pdf,these data are the first to demonstrate that membership in a stigmatized social group moderates reflexive reactions to ostracism.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf35.pdf,this study is also the first to demonstrate that attributing rejection to racial prejudice does not buffer the immediate harm of ostracism; that a group-based stigmatized identity may be detrimental when it comes to recovering from even a brief encounter of ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf35.pdf,attributions to prejudice significantly mediated the relationship between inclusion and reflective needs for both whites and african americans.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf35.pdf,"perhaps attributing ostracism to prejudice and discrimination provided ruminative material that served to focus participants on their experiences, preventing distraction and slowing recovery."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf35.pdf,one of the most interesting effects observed in our data is that of african american participants who attributed ostracism to racial prejudice regardless of the source of their rejection; white participants attributed ostracism to prejudice only when excluded by out-group players.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf35.pdf,"these results are consistent with research suggesting african americans (but not whites) experience racial prejudice from fellow african americans (i.e., intra-group prejudice) as well as from individuals of other racial groups (i.e., inter-group prejudice)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf35.pdf,"further, maddox and gray (2002) drew from historical evidence of skin-tone bias and demonstrated that both black and white perceivers evaluated dark-skinned black targets more negatively and stereotypically than they did light-skinned blacks."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf35.pdf,"given african americans' history of within-group prejudice, it seems logical that our african american participants would be willing to attribute ostracism to prejudice regardless of the source."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf35.pdf,"however, the use of contemporary stereotypic black names (e.g., shaniqua) in our study may have signaled within-group racial differences that correlate with skin-tone bias."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf35.pdf,to the extent such names may signal social class and education - characteristics that have historically been associated with skin-tone variance - our black participants may have inferred skin-tone differences which in turn afforded attributions to racism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf35.pdf,"because we sampled individuals across the life span and beyond the college setting, individuals in our sample also may have had more personal experience with prejudice, including experience with intragroup prejudice."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf35.pdf,"if so, these experiences could further account for african americans' willingness to attribute in-group members' ostracism to racial prejudice."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf35.pdf,"unfortunately, necessary constraints to the data collection process precluded collecting measures of prior experiences with prejudice that might elucidate such arguments."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf35.pdf,"regardless of the antecedent of this effect in our study, the finding has potentially important implications for understanding the costs of prejudice for individuals who belong to stigmatized groups."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf35.pdf,"more specifically, these data would suggest that the stresses associated with experiencing prejudice may not be limited to intergroup prejudice, but may also occur when individuals experience prejudice at the hands of fellow in-group members."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf35.pdf,models that focus solely on targets' attributions of intergroup prejudice may be missing a piece of the puzzle when it comes to predicting negative health outcomes and coping.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/brown-et-al-2009-social-inclusion-facilitates-interest-in-mating.pdf,"for example, an individual threatened by a predator or by hunger is likely to place greater immediate value on behaviors that facilitate survival, rather than focusing on the identification and pursuit of potential mates."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/brown-et-al-2009-social-inclusion-facilitates-interest-in-mating.pdf,"building on this logic of goal prioritization, we argue that the experience of social inclusion, or the experience of stable group membership, acts as a proximal indication that survival-based needs have been met, and as such, individuals can ""reprioritize"" their resources and interests toward mating-related activities."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/brown-et-al-2009-social-inclusion-facilitates-interest-in-mating.pdf,some of the most convincing evidence for the value of social inclusion comes from research documenting the variety of negative consequences that occur when this need has been thwarted.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/brown-et-al-2009-social-inclusion-facilitates-interest-in-mating.pdf,social rejection is believed to evoke a number of stable responses precisely because it threatens this basic need.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/brown-et-al-2009-social-inclusion-facilitates-interest-in-mating.pdf,"to date, the literature has revealed a number of reliable consequences of social rejection, many of which are often viewed as harmful, including increased aggression (leary, twenge, and quinlivan, 2006), impaired self-regulation (baumeister, dewall, ciarocco, and twenge, 2005), and reduced intelligent thought (baumeister, twenge, and nuss, 2002)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/brown-et-al-2009-social-inclusion-facilitates-interest-in-mating.pdf,"therefore, individuals whose survival needs have been satisfied and who now have access to potential mating partners should focus their efforts on pursuing relationships with those potential partners."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"recently, kraut and colleagues (kraut et al., 1998) reported that individuals who used the intemet for just a year or two were more likely to become depressed and lonely--a finding that to some was counter intuitive"

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"as a result, the quality of interaction decreases, resulting in feelings of loneliness, depression, and generally a lowered sense of belonging."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"this deleterious effect is further compounded when we consider observations that internet users often perceive that they are being ignored (rintel & pittam, 1997a, 1997b)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"whether deliberate or not, one can only imagine the impact that being ignored may have on individuals who are using a medium that already predisposes them to depression and loneliness."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"young children use forms of ostracism on each other during supervised play (barner-barry, 1986), and adolescents, particularly girls, are likely to use ostracism in their conflicts (cairns, calms, neckerman, & ferguson, 1989)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"elderly citizens' reports of feeling ignored by society, colleagues, and family members are positively correlated with lower life satisfaction (madey & williams, 1999)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"sweeting and gilhooly (1992) reported that loved ones and health care professionals had been observed to cease interacting socially with dying persons, often discussing postmortem tasks and responsibilities with others in the dying person's presence, as if they were not there."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"research on ostracism its prevalence across time, cultures, and species has led to an increased interest in ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,ostracism was viewed as evolutionarily functional for the sources (it kept the group cohesive and made it more likely to survive) but devastating to the targets (who usually died or were forced to join other groups).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"in fact, the basis of many phenomena in social psychology resides in the assumption that individuals fear exclusion, rejection, and being ignored."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"because of this fear, individuals conform, comply, obey, ingratiate, improve their appearance, and manage their impressions to others in order to be included and feel like they belong (baumeister & leary, 1995)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,research on social ostracism has shown that it causes a host of psychologically aversive reactions in targets of ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"the aversive impact of social ostracism has been shown to increase when targets attribute the ostracism to their own personal shortcomings (dittes & kelley, 1956; nezlek, kowalski, leary, blevins, & holgate, 1997; pepitone & wilpizeski, 1960) or when the ostracism is done more blatantly than subtly (snoek, 1962)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"being ignored or rejected produced negative self evaluations even when individuals merely imagined (craighead, kimball, & rehak, 1979; samolis, 1994) or role-played being ostracized (williams, bernieri, faulkner, gada-jain, & grahe 2000; zadro & williams, 1998)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"targets of social ostracism usually feel less positively about the sources who ostracized them (geller et al., 1974; pepitone & wilpizeski, 1960), but when the opportunity is presented, they often try to get back into the good graces of the sources (snoek, 1962; williams & sommer, 1997)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"although there may be a common thread to these widely divergent phenomena, the model restricts the definition of ostracism to acts of being excluded and/or ignored, subjectively defined from either the sources' or targets' perspective."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"it can be perceived when unintended, attributed to mundane explanations (as might occur when one is not acknowledged in an elevator) or to reasons that are more strategic and punitive."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"unintentional ostracism may be perceived to be relatively meaningless (e.g., ""the other person did not hear me"") or extremely self-relevant (e.g., ""the other person thinks so little of me as to not notice my existence"")."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"because of the many ways to interpret such acts, we believe ostracism is rather unique in terms of its inherent ambiguity."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"because silence usually accompanies being ignored, these questions are left unanswered."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"ambiguity by itself has been shown to be aversive (edwards, 1998; grieve & hogg, in press; lieberman, cathro, nichol, & watson, 1997), but when linked to ostracism, it can lead to damaging introspections and attributions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"when attributions for ostracism can reflect plausibly on the self, it can be even more aversive, because it has the potential to threaten fundamental needs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"the core of the model is the proposition that ostracism, compared with other aversive interpersonal behaviors, uniquely and quickly threatens four fundamental needs: belonging, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"ostracism deprives targets of their sense of belonging, because all signs of bondedness are severed."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,ostracism is not simply disagreeing with targets or pointing out their shortcomings it is an active denial of being connected with the target.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"furthermore, because ostracism is associated with punishment, it carries with it the implicit accusation that the target has done something wrong."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"implicit negative feedback, perhaps especially when it is not linked to any specific behavior, should threaten targets' sense of selfesteem."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,ostracism threatens targets' perceived control over the interaction with the source(s).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"although exchanging verbal accusations or punches with sources is unpleasant, they can still provide the target with a sense of control or influence over the interaction."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,a sense of control is lost when targets are unable to elicit any reactions from sources.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"like other forms of mortality salience, ostracism should threaten people's sense of meaningful existence and remind them of the fragility of their lives."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"as a result of these threatened needs, targets of ostracism are hypothesized to react initially with psychological discomfort, including negative mood, anxiety, physiological arousal, and hurt feelings."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"williams's (1997) model proposes that, to defend against this psychological discomfort, individuals will cope by attempting to regain or refortify their lost or threatened needs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"for example, threats to belonging can be refortified by selectively remembering group information (gardner, pickett, & brewer, 2000), reminding oneself of groups to which one belongs, intensifying the love one has for others, or conforming to group norms (baumeister & leary, 1995)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"whereas prior research has focused on the impact of physical and social ostracism, we believe that perceptions of exclusion and ignoring can also occur in virtual reality."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,cyberostracism may be more or less frustrating and debilitating than social or physical ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"it has the potential to be more ambiguous (e.g., what appears to be ostracism may be intended or it may reflect a technological problem) and it lacks useful cues usually available to targets in faceto-face interactions that might help clarify the situation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"on the other hand, the ambiguity might offer the target a nonthreatening excuse for being ignored (e.g., a technological difficulty), and the paucity of cues may allow the target enough anonymity and distance to deflect any possible effects of being ignored."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"accordingly, in experiment 1, we hypothesize that targets of cyberostracism will report lower levels of belonging, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"in experiment 2, we hypothesize that when targets of cyberostracism have the opportunity to cope with their psychological discomfort, they will be more likely to conform to others as a means to refortify their sense of belonging."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"previous laboratory research (williams & sommer, 1997) indicated that in a relatively short and seemingly innocuous face-to-face triadic balltoss interaction, participants who were not thrown the ball readily perceived being excluded and felt bad compared with participants who were included."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"although partial ostracism may produce doubts and frustration, it could also be misperceived and dismissed."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"complete ostracism, however, should leave participants with no plausible interpretation other than that they are being excluded."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,another reason for varying quantity of ostracism is that it allows us to eliminate an alternative explanation.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"being a target of ostracism may be unpleasant simply because the individual feels conspicuous or self-aware (carver & scheier, 1981)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,being included as an equal partner in a triadic tossing game would not make the participant feel conspicuous.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"we felt that being the object of inattention was not the same as being the object of attention, so we hypothesized that overinclusion would not be aversive, whereas ostracism would be."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,our general prediction for quantity of ostracism was that greater amounts of ostracism would lead to stronger aversive reactions.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"research on rejection sensitivity of people low in selfesteem led us to test whether, compared with those higher in self-esteem, low self-esteem individuals would experience greater negative impact to ostracism relative to inclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"for instance, schneider and turkat (1975) reported that low self-esteem individuals were more dependent on the evaluations of others in determining their sense of self-worth."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,baldwin and sinclair (1996) found that low self-esteem individuals held negative cognitive schemata that predisposed them to interpret socially ambiguous responses as rejection.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,found that individuals who had either scored low on trait self-esteem or high in depression tended to feel less accepted when they believed they were personally rejected by others in the group but more accepted when they were personally included by the group.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"thus, we predicted that there would be a main effect for self-esteem, such that lower levels of self-esteem would lead to higher levels of aversive impact, but we also were looking to see if self-esteem would interact with quantity of ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"if lower self-esteem predisposes individuals to perceive negative feedback, then they should be more likely to perceive and react negatively, even with partial ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"finally, based on our theoretical model, we expected that the effect of ostracism on self-reported psychological discomfort would be mediated by the degree to which the four needs were threatened."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,participants were informed that recent studies found mental visualization of an action or task to be beneficial to real-world performance and that this study evaluated the use of the computer as a tool in aiding mental visualization.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,we used the address as an identifier so that data from the preexperimental and post experimental questionnaires could be combined and to discourage participants from accessing the study more than once.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"the time taken by each of the computer generated players to make their decision and throw the flying-disc was varied each turn to increase the believability that they were also ""real"" participants."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"we recognize that, especially over the internet, participants may misrepresent themselves (i.e., males posing as females, teenagers posing as adults, and so forth)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"items measuring belongingness, control, and self-esteem were reverse scored such that higher scores for each measure indicated a greater need threat (lowered perception of currently possessing that need)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,increasing quantities of ostracism led to greater persistence up through partial ostracism; then persistence dropped for complete ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"higher index scores meant participants were more negatively affected (scores ranged from 8 to 72, mdn = 40)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"as can be seen in table 1, increasing quantities of ostracism led to greater aversive impact."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"according to baron and kenny (1986), mediation occurs if the independent variable predicts the dependent variable, the independent variable predicts the mediator, and the mediator predicts the dependent variable controlling for the independent variable in the model."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"the model proposes that ostracism (the independent variable) can threaten each of four needs (the mediators), which in turn, lead to psychological discomfort in individuals (the dependent variable)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"because belongingness and self-esteem were moderately correlated, (r = .59, p < .01), we investigated the extent that belongingness and self-esteem were unique mediators in the relationship between ostracism and aversive impact."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"the regression analysis revealed that belongingness (/3 = 3.3, se = .12) and self-esteem (/3 = 1.24, se = .12) significantly predicted aversive impact (bothps < .001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"thus, they both appear to uniquely contribute to the relationship between ostracism and aversive impact."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"although perceived control and meaningful existence were not influenced by the quantity of ostracism, they independently influenced aversive impact."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"aversive impact, as measured by negative mood, intensity of ostracism, and low group cohesiveness, increased as ostracism became more complete."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"these negative consequences were obtained despite the fact that, because participants were accessing the internet in their own private environments, they were insulated from public embarrassment and ridicule."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,this result points to the strength and potency of ostracism; it can be felt even in the artificial and minimal social environment that we created over the internet.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"this finding suggests that the need for belonging is particularly sensitive to even remote social cues, adding further support to baumeister and leary's (1995) claim that the need to belong is fundamental to human motivation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"although we could not check, we believe this endorsement was responsible for our unexpectedly large sample size; apparendy, many teachers encouraged their students to participate in our experiment."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"other studies using social ostracism (i.e., ostracism by others who are in the presence of the target) have found that both control and meaningful existence are negatively affected (lawson williams & williams, 1998; williams, shore, & grahe, 1998; williams & zadro, 1999)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"the lack of effects for these two needs in this study may be because they are not as relevant during cyberostracism, or at least during a brief period of cyberostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,perhaps the issue of control is less salient when we sit and watch the other players continue their exclusive interaction on the screen as compared with watching them in one's own presence.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,it is also possible that participants experienced some control even in the ostracism conditions because they had to click the word next to continue the game.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"and, meaningful existence may only be implicated by the feeling of invisibility (the death metaphor) that targets get when others present do not appear to see or hear them."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"of the four needs, threats to meaningful existence may be the slowest to engage."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"it is also possible that because our measures for control and meaningful existence were worded more abstractly (almost as traits), they were less sensitive to momentary changes."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"we also found, as predicted, that perception of ostracism and the aversive impact experienced from it followed a linear trend, increasing with greater levels of ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"the more we are ignored and excluded, the more we notice it, and the worse it becomes."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"participants were more likely to play the game as they went from being overincluded to included to partially ostracized, but when completely ostracized, they quit sooner."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"perhaps this can best be understood in behavioral terms: partial ostracism, like partial reinforcement, may increase persistence; but when all reinforcement is removed, extinction follows."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"first, although both overinclusion and ostracism may make targets feel conspicuous, our results indicated that overinclusion was not aversive, whereas ostracism was."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"being overincluded, however, was not a more positive experience than being equally included."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,we predicted individuals with lower levels of self-esteem would be particularly sensitive to ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"consistent with this prediction, we found that self-esteem was positively correlated with estimates of number of throws received, and negatively correlated with aversive impact."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,they found that individuals who were either low in self-esteem or high in depression were more sensitive to signals of rejection.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"consistent with our finding, leary, haupt, strausser, and chokel (1998) reported that trait self-esteem did not moderate participants' reactions to interpersonal rejection."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"experiment 2 in 1951, schachter (1951) found that after attempts to change the view of a nonconformist in the group failed, the group chose to reject and exclude the nonconformist."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,he never completed this research because he faced numerous logistical and ethical difficulties when he attempted to physically isolate participants.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"research on social, and now cyber, ostracism indicates, however, that it is not necessary to physically isolate individuals to make them feel excluded and rejected."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"if nonconformity can result in ostracism, might not ostracism encourage individuals to conform as a means to refortify their sense of belonging?"
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"in experiment 1, we showed that ostracism deprived targets of a sense of belonging, which, in turn, led to reports of worsened mood, feelings of exclusion, and perceptions of low group cohesion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"baumeister and leary (1995) argued that the need to belong, defined as frequent, affectively pleasant, and stable interactions with a few others, is a powerful and extremely pervasive human motivation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,baumeister and tice (1990) postulated that human beings function to minimize social exclusion by engaging in achievement oriented behaviors (demonstrating their ability and willingness to contribute to the group) as well as by accommodating to group standards.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,one way to accommodate to group standards is to conform to group judgments.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"according to williams's (1997) model of ostracism, targets' reactions to short-term ostracism involve the desire to fortify needs that were threatened or deprived."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"because cyberostracism reduced participants' sense of belonging in experiment 1, they should desire to reestablish bonds with other individuals."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"therefore, by arranging the experimental task such that participants have the opportunity to make perceptual judgments following the unanimously incorrect judgments of five other individuals, we hypothesize that, compared with individuals who were previously included, targets of ostracism will be more likely to conform to the group norm."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,we also examined whether the behavioral consequences of ostracism are greater if psychological ties between the targets and the sources are stronger.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,we hypothesized that targets of ostracism by ingroup members will conform more than targets of ostracism by out-group members.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"in support of this, reicher (1984) found that individuals endorsed attitudes that showed greater conformity to their own group norm than to an out-group norm during a discussion on the topic of vivisection."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"more recently, mackie, gastardo-conaco and skelly (1992) found that whereas prior knowledge of the in-group position produced acceptance of the in-group position regardless of the message quality (i.e., even for non membership relevant messages), messages from an out-group source produced almost no attitude change."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"from an attributional standpoint, self-blaming attributions should be greatest when individuals are ostracized by in-group members."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"when ostracized by out-group members, targets may easily diffuse the negative impact of ostracism through the use of external, group-level attributions (e.g., ""they are not throwing me the ball because of something about them, or because i am not in their group"")."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"ostracism by in-group members should be less easily attributable to differences in group membership, resulting in more internal self-blaming attributions (e.g., ""they are not throwing me the ball because of something about me personally""), which should have greater aversive impact on targets."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"we believe that ostracism by a mixed-group will be threatening, although to our knowledge there are no studies examining mixed-group influence."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"when ostracized by a mixed-group, targets may be less likely to attribute the ostracism to group membership, because even the in-group member is excluding them."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"perceptions of betrayal by the in-group member may also be particularly keen, and the reason for being ostracized becomes very ambiguous."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"therefore, targets may be led to make more internal, self-blaming attributions for the ostracism (e.g., ""i am such a loser that my in-group member is choosing to conspire with the out-group member."")"
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"our prediction then, is simply that ostracism by a mixedgroup will be as threatening and unpleasant as ostracism by ingroup members."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"we felt that regrouping participants with new members would provide a stronger test of the hypothesis: if ostracism increases the need to belong, it should increase conformity, even with a new group of individuals."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"this high rate of withdrawal is a concern, and may be one unavoidable drawback of on-line research."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,we feel that the large dropout rate may have been because of the lengthy time lags and technical incompatibilities that on-line users faced.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"not only did targets of ostracism report lower levels of belonging (as they did in experiment 1), but they were also more likely to conform to the unanimous incorrect judgments of a new group."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"thus, consistent with our theory, individuals reacted to a short-term episode of ostracism by refortifying the need that was threatened belonging by conforming to a new group."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"it was conceivable that inclusion could have decreased conformity, because these individuals had already experienced sufficient inclusion to remove any attractiveness associated with conforming to another group."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"in other circumstances, it might have been reasonable to expect included participants to have increased their levels of conformity, but we believe this would have only made sense if the subsequent perception task had been performed with the group that had included them."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"these findings also lend support to the notion that ostracism serves to promote normative behaviors in the targets (gruter & masters, 1986)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"at an evolutionary level, gruter and masters (1986) argued that the use of ostracism is adaptive because it maintains the cohesiveness of the group, either by removing the deviant member(s) or by bringing deviant members back into the fold."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,the results are also consistent with schachter's (1959) speculations that isolation will increase affiliative tendencies.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,the results of this study provide suggestive evidence that ostracism is a process that works similarly across species.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"we also examined whether the relation between participants and their sources affected their perceptions of exclusion, sense of belonging, and subsequent conformity."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,we predicted that participants who were ostracized by out-group members would be less affected than those who were ostracized by in-group members.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"the sole exception was the in group ostracism condition, in which participants reported receiving the ball about as often (29%) as would be expected if they were equally included (33%), when in fact they only received the ball 20% of the time."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"the inconsistency between the conformity results on the one hand, and the inclusion and belonging measures on the other hand, suggests that participants who were ostracized by in-group members were affected by the ostracism but did not want to admit it, to us or maybe even to themselves."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"it is also possible that by simply being categorized in an in-group, participants felt more included, which may have reduced perceptions of intragroup distinctions, as suggested by our belongingness data."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"according to social identity theory, we would have expected that individuals ostracized by in-group members would have been more threatened, and hence would have conformed more, than individuals ostracized by out-group members."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"therefore, belonging should not mediate conformity in the way that it mediated aversive impact in experiment 1. two of baron and kenny's (1986) three criteria were satisfied: the independent variable, ostracism, significantly affected the proposed mediator, belonging; and ostracism significantly affected the dependent variable, conformity."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"when we operationally defined conformity as the percentage of participants who conformed at least once, the pattern was then such that participants ostracized by in-group or out-group members showed similar percentages of conformity."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"thus, regardless of how conformity was operationally defined, being ostracized by out-group members was just as effective in producing conformity as being ostracized by in-group members."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"perhaps ostracism by anyone is sufficiendy aversive to trigger efforts to increase one's belongingness status, especially to a new group."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"had we examined how likely participants would have been to conform to those who ostracized them instead of how likely they were to conform to a new, unfamiliar group, perhaps the social identity prediction would have been supported."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"the mixed-group participants accurately reported the level of exclusion, reported lower levels of belonging when ostracized, and had high levels of conformity."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"perhaps as long as there are out-group members in the ostracizing group, targets of that ostracism are less likely to distort or disguise what actually happened."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"until now, the deleterious effects on targets have been observed when the sources of ostracism are physically present with the target--what we call social ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"in the two experiments reported here, we have demonstrated that the impact of ostracism is so powerful that it can even be felt when two ostensible sources ignore and exclude individuals over the intemet."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,when participants were cyber ostracized their sense of belonging and inclusionary status was reduced.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"this, in turn, worsened their mood and increased their feelings of exclusion, and in study 2, cyberostracism increased participants' likelihood to conform."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"it is rather astounding that despite the fact that our participants did not know, could not see, could not communicate with, and were not anticipating future interaction with ""virtual others,"" they felt ostracized when these others neglected to throw them a virtual disc or ball."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"on the one hand, we found in experiment 1 that ostracism was just a s debilitating to high as to low self-esteem individuals, and in experiment 2 we found that ostracism increased conformity regardless of whether the ostracizers were in-group members or not."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"apparently, ostracism was powerful enough to overwhelm these typically potent personality and situational variables."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"on the other hand, the pattern of results in experiment 2 suggests that perhaps with stronger manipulations of group identification or greater experimental control to reduce variability, identification with the ostracizing group may result in stronger effects."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"ostracism was hypothesized to threaten targets' fundamental needs, including belonging, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"with our internet paradigm, we found evidence that cyberostracism negatively affected feelings of belonging and selfesteem, but we found no impact on reports of control or meaningful existence."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"furthermore, the model predicts that when fundamental needs are threatened by short-term ostracism, targets will try to repair, regain, or fortify these threatened needs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"hence, because belonging was threatened in experiment 1, we predicted and found that targets of ostracism would attempt to regain a sense of belonging by conforming to a new group when the opportunity arose."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"a more serious problem is that we had exceptionally high dropout rates, especially in experiment 2. this suggests that the results may have been due to self-selection, such that only the types of people who would continue on with the experiment would give this pattern of results."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Cyberostracism_Effects_of_being_ignored.pdf,"it is just as plausible, however, that individuals who were most bothered by the ostracism would have dropped out, thus, making our findings of reactions to ostracism more conservative."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"bullying takes many different forms of negative actions, ranging from physical abuse (e.g., hitting, kicking) and verbal abuse (e.g., name-calling) to more subtle forms like isolation and social exclusion from a group."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"it has been repeatedly argued that subtle acts of aggression should always be included in the definition of bullying in order to fully grasp this phenomenon because the act of bullying is aimed at humiliating the victim and always has a psychological component (alsaker, 2004)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"as a consequence, social exclusion is known to be a common and powerful tool to bully peers."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"the need to belong is central and fundamental to humans (bastian & haslam, 2010; baumeister & leary, 1995) and the act of being excluded from a group generates strong feelings of social pain and distress (williams, 1997; 2001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"moreover, it is associated with depression (gazelle & ladd, 2003), low self-esteem (leary, tambor, terdal, & downs, 1995), poor academic achievement (graham & juvonen, 1998), and dropping out of school (graham & juvonen, 1998; juvonen & gross, 2005; rubin bukowski parker 2006)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"in fact, experiments have shown that social exclusion threatens four fundamental needs: sense of belonging (zadro, williams, & richardson, 2004), self-esteem (zadro et al., 2004; williams et al., 2000), sense of meaningful existence (williams, 2001, 2007) and control (williams et al., 2000)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"even though social exclusion has devastating consequences for the victims, it is sometimes still dismissed as a harmless rite of passage or as an inevitable part of growing up (alsaker, 2012)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"this is especially true for single incidences of social exclusion (or bullying in general), which are occasionally described as non-dramatic or even trivialized (alsaker, 2012)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"however, in particular, children with a longer history of school victimization may be extremely sensitive to single episodes of exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"individuals differ in how they process information about acceptance and rejection (downey & romero-canyas, 2005; zadro, boland, & richardson, 2006), and based on their previous history victims might have developed particular cognitive affective networks (w¨olfer & scheithauer, 2012)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"in a major study, rosen, milich, and harris (2007) found that students who were identified as victims were much more likely to report frequent victimization."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"moreover, a history of victimization was associated with a significantly higher degree of arousal with regard to the victimization narrative task, as well as greater difficulty in regulating emotions in high stress social situations (e.g., online ball tossing game)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,rosen and colleagues (2007) concluded that victims identified with the role of victim and seemed to internalize their victimization experiences into their implicit selfconcept.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"overall, there is evidence indicating that students who have a history of victimization and students who had not been involved in bully/victim problems respond differently to social exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"second, within the ostracism condition, we expected the victimized students to report significantly lower scores for all four needs (h2a) and a less positive mood at posttest compared to students not involved in bully/victim problems (h2b)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"it was important to restrict the analyses to these two categories because the two subgroups of victims - passive victims and aggressive victims - exhibit a different behavioral pattern (alsaker, 2004, olweus, 1978; perren & alsaker, 2006)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"aggressive victims are victims who act aggressively themselves and therefore show a pattern of behavior that is typical for both victims and bullies (alsaker, 2004; olweus, 1978; perren & alsaker, 2006)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"for ethical reasons, students who were assigned to the ostracism condition were invited to play cyberball in an inclusion condition before leaving."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"more specifically, we examined whether self-reported victimization moderates the aversive psychological (need-threat) and affective (mood) consequences of an experimentally induced episode of exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"extending previous research, the most important finding of the current study was that victims of bullying responded more sensitively to being excluded in terms of lower mood levels and feelings of less meaningful existence."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,meaningful existence is about feeling that one's life has a purpose and that this purpose is recognized by others.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"compared to self-esteem, i.e., how one feels about oneself, meaningful existence focuses more on the mechanisms through which these feelings are formed."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,the items assessing meaningful existence may therefore better capture the core issue of social exclusion as well as the central mechanism of bullying in general.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"psychological well-being is at least partly dependent on the perception that one is valued by others (pyszeczynsky, greenberg, & solomon, 1997)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"therefore, the well-being of victims may be especially disturbed by systematic and repeated bullying attacks."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"in fact, alsaker (2012) has argued that the discrepancy victims perceive between their suffering and the trivialization expressed by others triggers feelings of not being a valuable person, or as williams puts it, not having a meaningful existence (williams, 2001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,this experimental study lends support to these assumptions by showing that the perceptions and feelings of victims are profoundly damaged and that their negative feelings may be easily activated even in virtual ostracism situations.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,mood was also more affected from short episodes of social exclusion in students who view themselves as passive victims.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,individuals differ however in how easily their mood is affected through such events.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"mood is generally less affected in adults t we nge bau meister tice stucke, 2001; zadro et al., 2004) and adults have also been described as more stable compared to children and adolescents (larcom & isaacowitz, 2009) indicating that self-confidence and stability might moderate the impact of unexpected events on mood."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"this in turn might explain, why passive victims, who seem to be generally less self-confident and less stable (alsaker, 2006; boulton & smith, 1994) are more strongly affected by negative events."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,in general our findings suggest that being victimized may bias how subsequent exclusion situations are interpreted and being victimized may be associated with lower rates of recovery (because the devastating episodes are experienced repeatedly).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"in a similar vein, zadro and colleagues (2006) reported that highly anxious adults (mean age 22 years) recovered more slowly from the effects of exclusion compared to non-anxious participants."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"in line with the finding that frequently experienced victimization might lead to incorporating the role of ""victim"" into one's social schemas (rosen et al., 2009), our results showed that students who perceive themselves as victims responded more intensively to a short episode of social exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"single episodes of victimization that might seem harmless for teachers and for other students, would activate the cognitive affective network in the victim who perceives the ""minor incidence"" more negatively."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,consequently single incidences of victimization should be seen as adding burden to a history of victimization.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,it often happens that victims of bullying change class or even school.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"however, our results suggest that changing the situation might not be the appropriate action."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,the history of victimization remains unchanged and the cognitive affective networks of victims might put them at risk to become a victim in a new situation.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"today, researchers agree that bullying constitutes a serious risk with respect to the psychological, social and academic adjustment of victims (buhs, ladd, & herald, 2006; hawker & boulton, 2000)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"overall, the present study has demonstrated that although the aversive experience of exclusion may be universal, whether or not we recover from the experience may be moderated by victimization history."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"given the detrimental consequences of ostracism, those who are vulnerable or particularly susceptible to ostracism (e.g., victims of bullying) need to be identified early in order 1) to stop the victim's suffering, and 2) to stop negative cycles of exclusion, interpretations and expectations."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"previous studies have found that many teachers ignore and passively support bullying behaviors (alsaker, 2012; salmivalli, 2010; stassen berger, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,it is possible that teachers do not recognize the severity of bullying.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"in fact, cohn and canter (2002) reported that 25% of teachers see nothing wrong in bullying and intervene in only 4% of bullying incidents."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"likewise, teachers often indicate that they intervene if they perceive the situation as serious (newman, 2011)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"in fact, acknowledging the severity of bullying is the basic assumption for keeping the eyes open."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"unless bullying is acknowledged as disrespectful and unfair, teachers (and other witnesses) will not be motivated to recognize bullying and implement intervention measures."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"in summary, teachers first need to recognize the severity of bullying and the significance that a single incidence represents for the victims in order to recognize it when it happens and take responsible actions to stop it."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,our results emphasize that taking single episodes seriously may be especially important for victims of bullying who already show a history of rejection and exclusion.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"second, social exclusion is a common and powerful form of bullying and differs from other forms of bullying."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"unfortunately, due to the lack of visible scars in social exclusion, people often think that the victim is exaggerating since there is no visible trail for others to follow (alsaker, 2012; nordgren, banas, & macdonald, 2011)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"however, researchers agree that it is not necessary to be physically harmed in order to suffer lasting harm (alsaker, 2012; nordgren et al., 2011)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"by abrams et al., 2011 and sebastian et al., 2010 in that the participants received the ball more often before the exclusion episode started, and the total length of the episode was shorter."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggieri_et_al_IJDS_2013[1].pdf,"ostracism by a computer is sufficient to lower selfreported levels of belonging, control, self-esteem, and meaningful existence."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"we predict that when concealed, the illogical aggressive response to rejection is more likely, whereas when the rejected individuals' aggressive responses are perceived as public, the aggressive acts may be reduced."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"across experiments, when the opportunity to aggress was made public, rejected participants exhibited less aggressive behavior."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"when concerned about the perception of their public aggressive responses by others, rejected individuals' aggressive responses diminished compared with those whose actions were private."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"crucially, this extended to aggression visible only to neutral others, suggesting that effects cannot solely be due to fear of retribution."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"impression management theory further proposes that individuals actively manage their public self to create and maintain a social image (schlenker, 1980, 1982; tedeschi & norman, 1985)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"indeed, several experiments have indicated that people are motivated to enhance the self's public, and not private, image in order to appear desirable and important to others (baumeister, 1982; baumeister & jones, 1978)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"other evidence suggests that people will try to improve their public image to such a great extent that they would even endanger their own lives (leary, tchividjian, & kraxberger, 1994)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"and in fact, the importance of public image may be bonafide from an evolutionary perspective, as one's standing and social acceptance may have directly impacted one's chances of survival in the past (e.g., acceptance versus rejection from a social group leading to tangible benefits)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"an implication of this theory is that publicness should not only reduce aggressive behavior, but that publicness of aggression may increase the seeking of social ties (e.g., prosocial behavior)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"even laughter can trigger feelings of rejection when the target feels rejected by said laughter; in fact, such exclusion has been shown to result in greater temptations to aggress (klages & wirth, 2014)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"although there are conflicting results, a mix of evidence suggests that in some situations, prosocial behaviors or behaviors that may result in increased social connection (e.g., obedience, riva, williams, torstrick, & montali, 2014) can be a result of rejection (for a review, see williams & warburton, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"the aggressive response to rejection appears illogical and maladaptive, because it may encourage further rejection rather than acceptance."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"that is, people (other than perhaps the experimenter him or herself) would be largely unaware of the rejected individuals' aggressive reaction."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"however, the rejected participants were instructed to cover the allotted hot sauce, thereby maintaining the privacy of the aggressive act."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"for instance, twenge and her colleagues (2001) demonstrated that, following a rejection experience, participants provided harsher ratings of the rejector's suitability as a laboratory assistant."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"the aforementioned experimental results clearly demonstrate the relationship between rejection and subsequent aggression, but this link may be limited to relatively private acts of aggression."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"thus, despite theoretical support for such a proposition, it is unclear which circumstances lead to aggression (or lack thereof)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,it therefore remains to be seen whether or not rejection the journal of social psychology 65 leads to similar increases in aggression when others are aware of the aggressive act.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"as such, when people feel that their acceptance by others is threatened by an act of rejection, they may be particularly likely to seek social connections (baumeister & leary, 1995; maner, dewall, baumeister, & schaller, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"this may lead individuals to be less likely to aggress publicly, for fear of appearing socially undesirable."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"impression management of aggression because people (especially rejected people, baumeister & leary, 1995) are motivated to seek acceptance from others, acting aggressively in front of others may not be an effective strategy of regaining lost social connections."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"indeed, according to impression management theory, people will present themselves positively to gain social rewards (tedeschi & norman, 1985)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"thus, rejected individuals who want to regain the liking of others should try to ingratiate themselves to others in an attempt to demonstrate a positive identity as likeable and worthy of acceptance (tedeschi & reiss, 1981)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"reacting aggressively in public would not serve impression management goals, but rather it may undermine one's likelihood of being accepted by others (schlenker, 1986)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"because people tend to avoid aggressive individuals, as this behavior is deemed unpleasant, becoming aggressive after rejection would likely decrease social appeal (smith & frohm, 1985; smith, pope, sanders, allred, & o'keefe, 1988)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"in sum, becoming publicly aggressive in response to rejection would be a maladaptive strategy for rejected individuals to pursue, because acting aggressively may limit their potential relationships with others."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,this suggests that the aggressive response to rejection may be more prevalent when the individual believes that a relationship with the rejectors is impossible or that they can seek revenge without risking future relationships with others.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"if rejected people think that being aggressive will lessen the opportunity to create relationships with either the rejectors, or neutral third-parties (more likely, given that the rejector has already suggested that a relationship is unlikely), they may temper their aggression."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"thus, when others are aware of the rejected individuals' reactions, they should avoid responding aggressively to the rejection."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"even though research has clearly demonstrated a strong link between rejection and aggression, we propose that this effect is limited to private forms of aggression."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"overview of current research whereas rejection typically increases aggression, we hypothesize that when the opportunity to respond aggressively is made public, rather than kept private, rejected participants will lessen their aggression."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"in one condition, participants were led to believe that their aggression would be exposed to others and potentially linked back to them."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"this comparison allowed us to evaluate participants' motivation to maintain positive relationships with neutral parties, as opposed to the possibility that its effect could solely be explained by fear of retribution."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"based on impression management theory, we predicted that people would be more likely to respond aggressively when the aggression is not known to others than when the aggression is public."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"given that these rejected participants were aware of the ""other"" participants' desire to become research assistants, and knowing that lower ratings would hurt the person's chances, this was deemed an aggressive act."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"lower acceptance ratings indicate greater feelings of rejection provided by self-report in response to the question ""i feel accepted."""
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,lower ratings of the other participant indicate higher levels of aggression.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"nonetheless, in line with our predictions for the manipulated variable of interest, these analyses indicate that participants were generally more aggressive when they believed that their ratings would be kept private."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,discussion these results suggest that the extent to which an aggressive act is made public may affect how aggressively a rejected person acts.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"that is, when the aggressive act is made public, individuals who have been rejected may not act as aggressively as if the aggressive act was kept private."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,this suggests that aggressive responses to rejection are more likely to occur when they are not likely to affect the chances of forming relationships with others.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"one limitation of this experiment is that participants in the public condition believed that both the other participants and the experimenter would witness their aggressiveness, whereas participants in the private condition thought their ratings would be entirely anonymous."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"thus, participants in the public condition may have been less aggressive because they feared retaliation from the target of their aggressiveness (i.e., the other participants) and not because they were concerned that other people (i.e., neutral parties such as the laboratory staff) would witness their aggressiveness."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"participants were led to believe that, in order to reduce experimental bias, the experimenter was unable to decide how much hot sauce to give each of the participants."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"as in previous research (e.g., lieberman et al., 1999), the amount of hot sauce placed in the cup was used as a measure of aggression, because the other participant had clearly indicated a dislike for hot sauce on their (fabricated) taste preference inventory and would be made to consume it."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"thus, in the public condition, both the cup type and the verbal reminder made it clear that the experimenter and the ""other"" participant would be aware of the any aggressive act (e.g., amount of hot sauce the ""other"" participant would be forced to consume against their wishes)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"thus, in the private condition, while the ""other participant"" would still be aware of the act of aggression, by appearances, no neutral third parties (e.g., experimenter or research staff) would be aware of the aggression."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"however, unexpectedly there was an interaction for perceived rejection, f(1, 51) = 4.10, p = .048, ηp 2 = .074. yet, this interaction is difficult to interpret and may be spurious because feeling rejected was rated after both the rejection and the public manipulations."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,greater amounts of hot sauce indicate higher levels of aggression.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,the means and standard deviations for these analyses are displayed in table 2. discussion the results of this experiment support the prediction that rejected individuals will temper their aggression if they believe that their aggressive act will be seen by others.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"critically, in the private condition of experiment 2, the rejectors would know that they were aggressed against (once they tasted the overly spicy food), but the neutral third party would not know of the aggressive act."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"thus, the reduced aggression in the public condition was not due to a fear of retaliation (which would be the same in the private condition) but rather a concern about how the neutral third party would perceive the aggressive act."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,participants likely held back their aggression because they were engaging in impression management.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"furthermore, the results of experiment 2 suggest that making the aggressive act public will reduce aggression for rejected individuals (as opposed to accepted individuals)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"this suggests that giving excessive amounts of hot sauce was a deliberate aggressive act, designed to hurt someone who had previously rejected the participant."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,general discussion the results from the current investigation suggest that the aggression that often follows rejection may be tempered when the aggression is made public to others.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"in experiment 1, socially rejected participants were kinder in their ratings of a target if they believed others would see their ratings."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,this effect was replicated in experiment 2-rejected participants allocated less hot sauce to a target when they believed that their hot sauce allocation would be visible to others.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"therefore, it is unlikely the aggression was tempered due to fear of retaliation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"instead, rejected participants restrained their aggression because they knew neutral third parties would know of their behavior."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,this was true when they felt they could do so without negatively impacting their future social outlook.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"critically, however, they publicly avoided aggressing when either the guilty rejectors (experiment 1) or other parties (experiment 2) might witness the aggression and develop a poor impression."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"in the present experiments, the aggressive response exhibited by rejected individuals was dependent on whether neutral third parties would know about their aggression, not on whether their aggression was traceable by the aggression target (the rejector)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"in other words, people are willing to aggress after being rejected if they think there is no way for others to know about the aggression (see maner et al., 2007 for a similar argument)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"thus, the aggressive act is limited to conditions when relationships with others are not being pursued or are not going to be further damaged, including potential relationships with either the rejector or with neutral third parties."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"specifically, our studies suggest that when aggression opportunity is made public, rejected individuals will limit their aggression."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"thus, previous research on rejection and aggression may have overstated the relationship between rejection and aggression as a result of ignoring instances when the opportunity to aggress is made public."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"clearly, being rejected negatively affects one's inclusionary status as well as one's self-perception (e.g., self-esteem; bernstein et al., 2013)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"following such an experience, individuals may be particularly likely to seize opportunities to gain acceptance by others."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"acting aggressively would likely thwart this motivation by reducing the chances of being subsequently accepted by the witnesses of the aggression (smith & frohm, 1985; smith et al., 1988)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"thus, consistent with the theory that in private settings, controlor existence related needs leading to aggressive actions may overpower needs that typically (and in public settings) affect behavioral reactions to rejection (e.g., belongingness and self-esteem needs; williams & warburton, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,our results demonstrate that the public awareness can mitigate the typical aggressive reactions to rejection.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"furthermore, our findings are consistent with previous research indicating that reactions can differ based on construal of the situation (e.g., smart, richman, & leary, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"in the current investigation, participants demonstrated less aggressiveness when their aggression would be witnessed by others."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"although the reason why they behaved this way was not explicitly tested in these studies, consistent with these theoretical explanations, it seems likely that rejected individuals did not want to appear aggressive so they could avoid being rejected again by other people."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"for example, it is possible that rejected people thought logically about aggressing in front of others, and after weighing their options, concluded that aggressive action would be detrimental."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"alternatively, the knowledge that others would know about their aggression may have lessened their feelings of hostility."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"clarification the journal of social psychology 73 of these underlying processes may improve our understanding for why rejection causes people to become privately, but not publicly, aggressive."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"that is, it is unclear how participants in our rejected, public aggression conditions would respond if they were given a subsequent opportunity to aggress privately."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"perhaps by limiting their aggression when others are watching, the desire to aggress dissipates."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"alternatively, it is possible that suppressing the desire to aggress only leads to a stronger aggressive impulse that would be acted on in a subsequent, more private context or in a more passive way."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"furthermore, it remains unclear how results would differ if rejected participants were given the opportunity to engage in prosocial acts immediately after rejection (rather than the opportunity to aggress, as in the current work) in public versus private circumstances."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"the current results suggest that perhaps the effect of making the prosocial reaction public may not enhance prosocial acts for accepted individuals, yet there may be a difference for rejected individuals."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"across two experiments, we found consistent evidence that rejected participants temper their aggressiveness when their aggression is made public as opposed to kept private."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/DeBonoLaytonFreemanMuraven2017.pdf,"thus, it appears that rejection does elicit aggression, but that this response depends on whether there are witnesses to the aggressive act."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,we interpret these results as evidence for the powerful impact of ostracism and the potential importance of distinguishing between qualitatively different outgroups.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"with acceptance, self-esteem is enhanced (leary, tambor, terdal, & downs, 1995), with social interaction, a sense of control is achieved (taylor & brown, 1988), and with recognition, a sense of meaning and worth is maintained (greenberg, solomon, & pyszczynski, 1997)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"even under superficial conditions, the immediate experience of ostracism is highly threatening."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"in an fmri study (eisenberger, lierberman, & williams, 2003), ostracism during cyberball was found to increase activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, a region that is associated with the experience of physical pain."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"both self-report and neuroscientific data therefore suggest that ostracism hurts (also see macdonald & leary, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,it is intriguing that individuals can be adversely affected by exclusion even when it does not occur face-to-face and the sources of ostracism are never seen.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"in fact, the negative impact of ostracism is not diminished by a host of factors that should logically do so."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"for example, although the effect of ostracism should be attenuated when it can be attributed to external causes (williams, 2001), individuals who can blame the social exclusion on computer malfunction are still adversely affected (eisenberger et al., 2003)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,the identity of the ostracism sources should also moderate its effects (williams).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,being ostracized by dissimilar others should be less upsetting than being ostracized by like-minded individuals.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"yet, even though people tend to prefer ingroup members over outgroup members (hewstone, rubin, & willis, 2002), ostracism by outgroup members is no less aversive than ostracism by ingroup members (smith & williams, 2004; williams et al., 2000, 2002)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"moreover, the sources of ostracism do not even need to be human for targets to feel its negative consequences."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"individuals who are told that they are playing cyberball with a computer still report having lower levels of belonging, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence following ostracism (zadro, williams, & richardson, 2004)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"these findings suggest that people have an in-built mechanism that automatically detects social exclusion and allows its painful effects to be felt (panksepp, 2003)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,the immediate experience of ostracism might be so overwhelming that people fail to sufficiently process factors that should render the exclusion trivial.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"this possibility is consistent with the idea that social exclusion leads to cognitive deconstruction, a state in which individuals avoid meaningful thought (twenge, catanese, & baumeister, 2003)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"humans may be predisposed to react strongly to ostracism because of the high costs of social exclusion during human evolution (macdonald & leary, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"in the evolutionary past, being excluded from a social group would have endangered an individual's overall fitness by reducing access to resources such as food and potential mates."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"consequently, social exclusion may be threatening to humans in a similar way to physically dangerous stimuli (e.g., snakes), and humans may respond to ostracism as they do to any fearful stimuli."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"nevertheless, it is possible that under certain conditions, people will not find ostracism distressing, and might even prefer it."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,previous studies have demonstrated that in group out group distinctions do not moderate the negative impact of exclusion.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"the kkk appears to be as hated in australia as it is in the united states, as evidenced by widespread censure of an incident in which australian army soldiers wore white kkk-style hoods to taunt aboriginal troops (action taken, 2004)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,intuitively it seems likely that individuals would not want to be included by such despised outgroups and would feel relieved to be ostracized by them.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"on the other hand, if the immediate experience of ostracism is so powerful that it prevents targets from processing trivializing information, then even ostracism by a despised outgroup will be aversive."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"consistent with evidence that social exclusion can lead to anti-social behaviors such as aggression (e.g., twenge et al., 2001, warburton et al., 2006), studies investigating attitudinal responses have found that people tend to derogate those who reject them (bourgeois & leary, 2001; buckley, winkle, & leary, 2004)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,this reaction has been interpreted as a coping strategy that reduces the desire to be accepted and subsequently minimizes the distress of rejection (bourgeois & leary).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,we predicted that derogation of the ostracism sources' group would occur only when the sources were outgroup members.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,individuals who are rejected by a despised or rival outgroup are likely to reaffirm their preference for the ingroup by displaying enhanced negativity towards the outgroup.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"in contrast, ostracism by ingroup members is unlikely to elicit derogation of the ingroup."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"because ostracized individuals are likely to want to maintain membership in their own group, it would not serve them well to derogate the ingroup."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"for example, if the participant's ingroup was labor party supporters, the rival outgroup was liberal party supporters and the despised outgroup was australian kkk supporters."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"however, a contrast analysis comparing control scores in the despised outgroup condition to control scores averaged over the ingroup and rival outgroup conditions, revealed that the magnitude of the ostracism effect was moderated by condition."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"specifically, it could be argued that because people do not like the kkk, any interactions with them (not just those involving ostracism) would be aversive."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"however, if this were the case, mood would be worse when the co-players were members of the kkk."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"consistent with previous research, ostracized individuals reported worse mood, and lower levels of belonging, selfesteem, control, and meaningful existence, than those who were included."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"in contrast, attitudinal responses were clearly influenced by the sources' group membership, with ostracized individuals reporting more negative attitudes towards their co-players' group only when that group was despised."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"together, these findings suggest that although ostracism by a despised outgroup can enhance negativity towards that group, being ostracized by a hated group may be as distressing as ostracism by groups that are not despised."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"these findings indicate that, perhaps because people are hard-wired to detect it, ostracism is an unpleasant experience, regardless of whom or what is doing the ostracizing."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,our findings are also consistent with evidence that belonging is valued even from undesirable groups.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"for example, in a recent study (wisman & koole, 2003), people whose mortality was made salient preferred to sit with others who opposed their worldview than to sit alone."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,we did not find clear evidence that ostracism by the despised outgroup was less distressing than ostracism by the other groups.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"second, there was a marginally significant effect of ostracism source on mood ratings, such that participants reported more positive mood when they played with their ingroup."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,a possible reason for this finding is that interacting with ingroup members boosts mood by reminding people of their belonging in a group regardless of what happens in the cyberball game.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"third, a non-significant trend appeared to suggest that the group identity of the sources moderated the effect of ostracism on self-reported control."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"specifically, ostracism by the despised outgroup appeared to reduce control to a lesser extent compared to exclusion by the ingroup and rival outgroup."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"as people might expect members of an extreme minority to interact only with each other, predictive control may have been highest in the despised outgroup condition."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,the finding that attitudinal responses were influenced by the sources' group membership also refutes the possibility that this manipulation was not sufficiently salient.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"in line with expectations, ostracism by ingroup members did not result in negativity towards the ingroup."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"also as predicted, participants who were ostracized by the despised outgroup derogated this group to a greater extent than did included participants."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"this finding is consistent with evidence that people feel negatively towards those who reject them (bourgeois & leary, 2001; buckley et al., 2004)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"surprisingly, however, ostracism did not provoke negativity towards the rival outgroup."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,it is possible that the mere mention of a more extreme and disliked outgroup made the rival outgroup seem more desirable and therefore less susceptible to derogation following ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"thus, the finding that ostracism led to outgroup derogation only when the sources belonged to the despised outgroup can be interpreted as evidence that ostracized individuals displayed anti-social responses only when social norms permitted."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"whether it is inflicted by unseen others, computers, or, as the present study demonstrates, despised outgroup members, ostracism is aversive."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,this evidence strengthens the view that humans are highly sensitive to cues signaling social exclusion.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"what this research does not say is that, with thoughtful reflection, reactions will remain the same despite one's feeling about the sources' group membership."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"we believe given enough time to consider the implications of ostracism by a despised group, individuals will be able to dismiss the negative reaction, and perhaps even rejoice in the memory that they were ostracized by despised others."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"perhaps with time, individuals who were included by the despised outgroup may become uncomfortable with that inclusion, and the fact that they continued to figure 3. visual depiction of despised outgroup condition in cyberball."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,"in contrast, those who were high on social phobia had only partially recovered, suggesting that factors that would logically interact with ostracism do so after individuals have had time to reflect on the ostracism episode."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf34.pdf,future research on ostracism by ingroups and outgroups of various sorts (rival and despised) should incorporate a reflective time period to examine the possibility that coping reactions will interact as a function of ostracism and source membership.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Virtual imposters  Responses to avatars that do not look like their controllers.pdf,experiment 2: volition and identifiability experiment 2 explored how ostracizers' volition in disguising their identities may affect how others respond to their anti-social behavior.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Being_In_With_the_In-Crowd_The_Effects_of_Social_E.pdf,"from this perspective, because rejection is such a potentially dangerous threat, the immediate flash of negativity and insult to basic needs are equivalently strong, regardless of who is doing the rejection."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Being_In_With_the_In-Crowd_The_Effects_of_Social_E.pdf,"however, for those in the maximal condition (highly essentialized), we predicted that exclusion should feel worse for ingroups than for outgroups whereas inclusion should feel better for ingroups than for outgroups."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"our focus in the present set of studies was on the immediate impact of ostracism to determine whether the large body of research showing the uniformly distressful reactions to ostracism is due primarily to the fact that ostracism is perceived to be costly, whereas inclusion is perceived to be beneficial."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"that is, if we were to create a situation in which people were punished for being included and rewarded for being ostracized, would the negative reactions to ostracism be reduced, eliminated, or even reversed?"
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"thus, ostracized individuals would have ended up being wealthier than the other ostracizing players."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"again, ostracized individuals would have been better off than included individuals because they were not under constant threat of losing all their experimental payoffs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"from a rational cost-benefit perspective, making inclusion costly ought to have relieved ostracized participants of all distress."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,people should not feel unhappy when ostracized if ostracism prevents them from losing money.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"from a rational perspective, it may therefore be argued that financial incentives should have mitigated ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"in fact, applying prospect theory (kahneman & tversky, 1979; ku¨hberger, 1998; tversky & kahneman, 1991), arguing that losses loom larger than gains, one could even predict that the difference between inclusion and ostracism might have been reversed."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"if people would rather minimize losses than maximize gains, then study participants should have felt worse when included in a loss game than when ostracized from a gain game."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"given this reasoning, then all that matters is that participants perceive themselves to be ignored and excluded."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,any mitigating factors related to this perception should be inconsequential to the immediate experience of ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"taking this perspective, we argued that even if we created a situation in which ostracism is financially beneficial and inclusion is financially costly, ostracism would still be painful, thwart fulfillment of fundamental needs, and increase sadness and anger."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"consequently, people made money when they were included in the gain game but lost money when they were included in the loss game."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"if individuals focus only on the monetary consequences as rational-person theorists would have us believe, then study participants should prefer to be included in a gain game and ostracized in a loss game."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"however, if immediate reactions to ostracism are indeed precognitive, as we believe, and override reflections of whether a situation has financial benefits, we would expect to find only a main effect of ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"it should lower the sense of belonging, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence and should increase negative mood, regardless of the financial implications of the situation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"combined with our ostracism manipulation, this arrangement meant that in the gain game, participants gained 5 euros when included but gained only 1 euro when ostracized and that in the loss game, participants lost 5 euros when included but only 1 euro when ostracized."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"this factor did not yield any significant results, apart from an occasional main effect of gender (i.e., men were more positive or less negative during the game, and their need satisfaction levels were higher regardless of condition) and was therefore dropped from the reported analyses."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"the €yberball experience effect showed that needs were more thwarted in the ostracism condition (m 3.02, sd 0.81) than in the inclusion condition (m 4.14, sd 1.02), supporting our hypothesis that ostracism is painful even when it pays."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,this is again consistent with our prediction that individuals would respond negatively to ostracism even when it was financially beneficial to be ostracized.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,the results showed that being ostracized lowered need satisfaction and mood.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"this analysis revealed that the effect of €yberball experience on needs remained significant, .37, t 6.15, p .000. taken together, these analyses show that needs mediate mood, not vice versa."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"discussion our results are consistent with those of previous research showing that ostracism appears to overwhelm factors that, rationally, ought to mitigate distressful reactions (zadro, williams, & richardson, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"again, ostracism seems to be a powerful experience, overriding even a pervasive incentive such as earning money."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"regardless of whether people earned money by being ostracized or not, ostracism lowered need satisfaction levels and mood."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"additionally, self-reported mood levels were mediated by the self-reported need satisfaction levels, and not the reverse, providing support for williams's need threat model of ostracism (williams, 2001; williams, in press; zadro, williams, & richardson, 2004)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,this may be a side effect of our payoff valence manipulation.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"people were endowed with 6 euros in the loss game and 0 euros in the gain game, and such an endowment may have caused participants to appreciate the experiment more in the loss conditions than in the gain conditions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,it could be argued that participants became used to losing or gaining a small amount of money and therefore 50 euro cents may not have been strong enough to moderate ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"furthermore, we endowed participants with 6 euros in the loss conditions and 0 euros in the gain conditions in study 1. a possible side effect of this may have been that people were more elated during the loss game than during the gain game."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"to address these issues, we altered our payoff valence manipulation in study 2 such that its effect would be stronger but would not endow participants with different amounts of money prior to participating in €yberball."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"they were informed that the ball-tossing game could stop at any moment and that the person holding the ball would either lose all his or her money or double all his or her money, depending upon the condition."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"in contrast with study 1 in which participants were confronted with small increments or decrements of money to which participants may have habituated, participants were now under constant threat of losing all their money (or were under the constant promise of doubling their money)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"overinclusion means being included more than what one would expect, given equal participation among the members of the group."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"similar to ostracism, overinclusion is likely to make participants feel conspicuous."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"the difference, however, is that overincluded participants are conspicuous by excessive attention, whereas ostracized participants are conspicuous by excessive inattention."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"added an overinclusion condition to their internet cyberball design (but for which there were no financial benefits or costs) and found that overinclusion tended to be a more positive experience than inclusion, although this effect was not significant."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,they included overinclusion to rule out that ostracism was distressing simply because it made participants feel conspicuous.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,our reason for adding an overinclusion condition is that participants should be able to register whether they are overincluded in a good situation or overincluded in a bad situation when asked to evaluate their satisfaction with needs and mood.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"we thought that participants would have unmoderated reflexive responses only to ostracism, not to overinclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,it also rules out the possibility that our need and mood measures are insensitive to detecting payoff valence differences.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"that is, after the initial pain and distress of ostracism that we think is unmoderated by situational constraints like gain or loss of payoff, we expect moderation for reflective behavioral responses."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"several studies have shown that when ostracized individuals have little control over their future inclusion or have been sufficiently deprived of a sense of control over any outcome, their reactions are hostile."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"not only are they more willing to lash out, but they are also less willing to donate to charity (twenge, 2005; twenge & baumeister, 2005; twenge et al., 2001; warburton et al., 2006)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"thus, we expected that differences in payoff valence (i.e., gain vs. loss) would be likely to moderate behavioral responses to ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,this expected interaction would again underscore our argument that only the immediate responses to ostracism are reflexive.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,it would also help to rule out the possibility that our payoff valence manipulation cannot elicit moderation when people are ostracized.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,one could argue on the basis of the prospect theory that participants should react more negatively to punitive attention than to a lack of positive attention.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"in line with this reasoning, williams and zadro (2001) reported that targets of long-term ostracism voluntarily state that they would have preferred to be beaten than to have been ostracized."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"instead of losing or gaining money each time a participant got the ball, participants were now informed that the game could stop at any moment and that the person holding the ball would then lose or double his or her endowment of 5 euros."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,note that we did not realize threats or promises because it is impossible to realize treats or promises in the ostracism conditions and because it would obscure the reason that people reacted to the inclusion and overinclusion conditions.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"at the time of the experiment, news about darfur was televised daily in the netherlands because of the war and famine, and people were called on to make donations to alleviate the suffering."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,receiving punitive attention was especially detrimental for self-esteem and belonging.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"as predicted, this result shows that individuals are capable of making rational cost-benefits analyses when overincluded."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"this comparison showed that participants reported lower need satisfaction levels when ostracized from gains than when overincluded with financial penalties, indicating that at least in this experiment, getting no positive attention had greater negative impact on need satisfaction levels than getting punitive attention, t(53) 6.00, p .000. mood."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"simple main effects analysis to interpret the interaction revealed that our manipulation of payoff valence only affected the overinclusion condition, f(1, 161) 8.51, p .004, 2 .05. participants felt worse when overincluded in a loss game than when overincluded in a gain game."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"furthermore, participants felt worse when ostracized from gains than when overincluded in losses, indicating that at least in this experiment, getting no positive attention caused moods to plummet more than getting punitive attention, t(53) 1.71, p .05. mediation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"the regression on mood controlling for needs showed that needs affected mood, .78, t 7.96, p .000, and made the €yberball experience effect on needs disappear, .08, t .80, ns."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"a sobel test showed that this reduction was (marginally) significant, z 1.90, p .06. these regression analyses show that need satisfaction levels mediated mood when participants were overincluded."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"simple main effects analysis also revealed that payoff valence only moderated prosocial behavior in the overinclusion condition, f(1, 161) 9.49, p .002, 2 .056. participants donated more to charity when overincluded in a gain game than when overincluded in a loss game."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,this is again in agreement with our reasoning that coping responses to €yberball experience are moderated by financial implications.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"that is, different from our findings with the measure of antisocial intent, ostracized participants were not less prosocial than participants who received punitive attention."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,participants found ostracism unpleasant even when it prevented them from losing all their money.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,subsequent mediation analyses replicated the findings of study 1 indicating that ostracism lowers need satisfaction levels and that this in turn negatively affects mood.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"we also found that whereas participants' negative reactions were not mitigated by payoff valence when being ostracized, they were mitigated when being overincluded."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"compared with people who were being included, ostracized people felt worse regardless of payoff valence, whereas overincluded people only felt worse in a loss game."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"this result provides further evidence that ostracism is indeed a powerful experience, overriding rational cost-benefit evaluations of a situation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,it also speaks to the sensitivity of our dependent variables because of their ability to reveal differences between the overinclusion conditions.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"in agreement with our reasoning that only the immediate responses to ostracism are highly resistant to moderation, we observed that the financial implications of a situation influenced only subsequent coping responses."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,people were especially aggressive when ostracized from a gain game and more prosocial when overincluded in a gain game.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,direct comparisons showed that participants felt worse in terms of need satisfaction and mood when they could not double their payoffs than when they were under the constant threat of losing all their payoffs.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"moreover, participants who could not double their payoffs were more willing to retaliate than participants who were under constant threat of losing all their payoffs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"combined, these results add empirical support to the notion that people might prefer getting punitive attention to getting no attention at all (williams & zadro, 2001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,results of both studies indicated that penalizing inclusion or making ostracism financially beneficial did not mitigate the phenom eno logical experience of being ostracized.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"regardless of whether people lost small amounts of their experimental earnings (study 1) or were threatened with losing all their money (study 2), people felt worse when ostracized from a costly situation than when included or even overincluded in a costly situation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,both study 1 and study 2 showed that need satisfaction levels mediated mood and not vice versa when people were ostracized.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"this indicates that, at least in our studies, mood was lowered because of an appraisal of needs, not that people's needs were thwarted because of lowered mood."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"this provides further support for the notion that immediate reactions to ostracism may indeed be precognitive and linked to pain (mcdonald & leary, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"in study 2, we found moderation on selfreports of need satisfaction and mood in our overinclusion conditions, suggesting that our measures are sensitive to social pressures."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,subsequent responses to ostracism we also observed that payoff valences interacted with €yberball experience on retaliation and donations to darfur.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,people reported desiring retaliation following ostracism but less so when ostracized from a loss game.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"furthermore, overincluded participants, especially those who were overincluded in a gain game, donated more money to charity than ostracized participants donated."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"this is consistent with previous research on antiand prosocial behavior that found that people seem to become more antisocial and less prosocial when excluded from a good situation (catanese & tice, 2005; twenge et al., 2001; warburton et al., 2006)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"an interesting contribution of our findings is that aggression was moderated by payoff valences when people were ostracized, whereas donations to charity were moderated by payoff valences when people were overincluded."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"although speculative, this finding might suggest that positive behavior is more likely to occur after positive antecedents, whereas negative behavior is more likely to occur after negative antecedents."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,whether this is indeed the case or whether this is perhaps due to the fact that our measure of negative behavior was directed at fellow participants whereas our measure of positive behavior was not directed at fellow participants remains to be examined in future research.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,what is important here is that ostracism increased aggression and decreased prosocial behavior but that these behavioral measures were mitigated by financial incentives.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"in the ostracism condition, people are the ""objects of others' inattention"" (williams et al., 2000, p. 169) and are singled out by receiving less attention than expected."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"in the overinclusion condition, people are singled out because they receive more attention than expected."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"who showed that being overincluded in a ball-tossing game without financial incentives is more rewarding than being included in a ball-tossing game, we show that well-being is indeed a linear function of inclusionary status in situations in which people earn money whenever they get a ball toss."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"instead, well-being went down in both the overinclusion and the ostracism conditions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"moreover, the fact that financial incentives moderated immediate responses to overinclusion but not to ostracism suggests that individuals process information differently in these situations."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,it seems that people do not process information about the pros and cons of a situation when singled out in terms of ostracism but do process such information when singled-out in terms of overinclusion.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,bridging two forms of peer rejection our paradigm also allowed for a comparison between being ostracized from the possibility of doubling one's money and being overincluded when loss of all of one's money loomed.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,results showed that participants responded more negatively both in terms of immediate responses and aggressive intentions when ostracized from the gain situation than when overincluded in the loss situation.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"this finding suggests that being ostracized is indeed a very negative experience, perhaps worse that being ganged up on in such a way that increases our chances of losing valued resources."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"we can link this finding to research on peer rejection that stresses that both ostracism and bullying are possible antecedents of aggressive behavior (juvonen & gross, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,the current findings concur that both these forms of peer rejection are perceived as painful.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"yet, we also show that, at least in our paradigm, ostracism is worse than our form of bullying."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"combined with the fact that in our paradigm, ostracized individuals were more willing to lash out than bullied individuals, our finding underscores the particularly negative impact and consequences of ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"a general finding in this literature is that losses loom larger than gains (kahneman & tversky, 1979; ku¨hberger, 1998; tversky & kahneman, 1991)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"in individual decision tasks, individuals are more likely to minimize their losses than to maximize their gains, and they react more strongly to a loss than to an equivalent gain."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"whereas a recent study showed that participants were more likely to ostracize others when negotiating about gains than when negotiating about losses (van beest et al., 2005), the present findings suggest that targets of ostracism do not appear to discriminate between being ostracized in a gain or a loss domain."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,an interesting implication then is that ostracizers may underestimate the damage they inflict when they ostracize people in a gain domain (or overestimate the damage in a loss domain).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"in such situations, getting payoffs or not getting them is often related to being included or excluded from an agreement."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"the current results suggest that people may indeed respond fiercely to violations of equality or equity (messick & sentis, 1979, 1983; walster & walster, 1975; walster, walster, & berscheid, 1978) in negotiation or distribution tasks but that those who do not obtain payoffs at all may feel worse."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"limitations and boundary conditions one concern that might be raised is that had we just offered enough money in the ostracism-gain condition, we would have eliminated the pain and distress of ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"we agree that there may certainly be some excessively high monetary amount that might obliterate the initial pain of ostracism, but we are skeptical that our chosen amounts were so low as to give unfair advantage to the ostracism manipulation for a few reasons."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"in fact, we adapted a payoff valence procedure that did impact coalition formation and thus the willingness to ostracize (van beest, et al."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"in light of other research, it seems to us most plausible that ostracism is at least momentarily painful despite offsetting factors that rationally should minimize individuals' appraisal of the importance and relevance of the ostracism experience."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"in the present studies, the pain appears to endure even when the meaning of ostracism is symbolically linked with relative wealth."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"our studies suggest that the need to belong, to feel good about oneself, to have some control over social interactions, and to be recognized as existing are potent motives that overwhelm rational thought when they are first threatened by ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/BeestWilliamsJPSP2006.pdf,"although it would seem plausible that, on reflection, ostracism from a loss game would be more easily dismissed as nonthreatening or perhaps even regarded as protective and nurturing, it might still diminish one's sense of self-worth and overall contribution to the group."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Duclosetal_2013_JCR.pdf,of particular relevance here is research by raghunathan and pham (1999) suggesting that sadness can foster riskier inclinations in both job selection and gambling decisions.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Duclosetal_2013_JCR.pdf,"as one might expect, experiencing social exclusion may very well engender a fair amount of negative mood in general and possibly sadness in particular."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Duclosetal_2013_JCR.pdf,"hence, to document the direct and unique impact of social exclusion on financial risk-taking, our work will attempt to disentangle affect from social exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Duclosetal_2013_JCR.pdf,a second alternative explanation for the proposed effect may lie in the influence of self-esteem on risk taking.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Duclosetal_2013_JCR.pdf,prior research shows indeed that interpersonal rejection can also function as a threat to self-worth (leary et al.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Duclosetal_2013_JCR.pdf,"finally, one might wonder whether financial risk-taking as a result of social exclusion is nothing more than the manifestation of self-defeating behavior (i.e., a ""deliberate action with clear negative effects on the self or on the self's projects""; baumeister and scher 1988)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Duclosetal_2013_JCR.pdf,"suggesting that the prospect of ending up alone in life (i.e., being rejected) can increase procrastinating with pleasurable activities rather than practicing for an upcoming test."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Duclosetal_2013_JCR.pdf,"indeed, because the expected value of our risky financial products is never inferior to that of their safer counterparts, opting for the former cannot be construed as an inferior course of action."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Duclosetal_2013_JCR.pdf,"as theorized earlier, we predicted that socially excluded participants would favor the riskier option (i.e., low odds/high reward) more strongly than their included counterparts."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Duclosetal_2013_JCR.pdf,"does exclusion lead to riskier behavior (as argued earlier), or, in contrast, does inclusion lead consumers to prefer safer options?"
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Duclosetal_2013_JCR.pdf,"after all, it is conceivable indeed that interpersonal rejection also leads to negative mood (warburton, williams, and cairns 2006)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Duclosetal_2013_JCR.pdf,"indeed, by documenting that excluded participants chose a riskier payment scheme more often than their included and baseline counterparts, study 2 suggests that social rejection, not acceptance, drove our findings in studies 1 and 2. second, study 2 clarifies the mechanism underlying our effect."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Duclosetal_2013_JCR.pdf,"indeed, although we readily concur that social exclusion can/does generate some degree of negative mood, the latter (by itself) failed to replicate the risk-taking tendencies exhibited by socially excluded participants."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"self-regulation resources are indispensable to deal with frustration or failure (schmeichel, vohs, & baumeister, 2003)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"as noted, searching for inconsistent information arouses the aversive motivational state of cognitive dissonance, evokes negative emotions, and threatens the self."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"thus, searching for inconsistent information requires considerable amounts of self regulation"
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"social exclusion impairs selfregulation and leads to impulsive, undercontrolled behavior (baumeister et al., 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"as a consequence, excluded participants should be less willing to face the negative affective and motivational implications of searching for preference inconsistent information and more willing to attain positive implications for the self by searching for preference consistent information."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,it is important to note that we postulate the effects of social exclusion on the confirmation bias to be due to the relation between social exclusion and self-regulation resources.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"one may argue that the primary effect of social exclusion is to threaten people's ego (i.e., positive evaluations of self)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"that is, simply receiving negative feedback may be sufficient to increase the bias toward preference consistent information."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"however, simply receiving bad news does not result in decreased self-regulation resources (baumeister et al., 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"moreover, previous research has shown that a simple ego threat does not increase the confirmation bias (dawson, gilovich, & regan, 2002; denes-raj & epstein, 1994; dunegan, 1993)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"in addition, when research revealed significant differences in mood (e.g., buckley, winkel, & leary, 2004), social exclusion did not mediate the effects of exclusion on behavioral outcomes."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"thus, it is unlikely that the effects of social exclusion on confirmatory information processing are due to mood states (cf."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"previous research has shown that having participants recall a previous experience of rejection from their actual lives evokes responses similar to those found in manipulations of immediate rejection (bastian & haslam, 2010; dewall & baumeister, 2006; pickett, gardner, & knowles, 2004)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,ostracism refusing to interact with others represents an important form of social exclusion.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"according to williams (2001), even minimal forms of ostracism by complete strangers are sufficient to cause distress."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,study 2 of the present research employed the cyberball paradigm and tested whether participants who experienced an episode of ostracism (relative to those who were included) would exhibit a stronger tendency for confirmatory information searching.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"relative to preference consistent information, searching for preference inconsistent information arouses the aversive state of dissonance (frey, 1986), evokes negative emotions (kruglanski & klar, 1987), and threatens the self (pyszczynski & greenberg, 1987)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"thus, searching for preference inconsistent information requires a certain willingness to alter one's impulsive response to neglect those pieces of information."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"as noted previously, social exclusion leads to undercontrolled behavior (baumeister et al., 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"therefore, excluded (relative to included) participants should be less willing to select preference inconsistent pieces of information (and more willing to select preference consistent pieces of information) because they anticipate reading preference consistent information to be more pleasant and reading preference inconsistent information to be more averse than do included participants."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"thus, study 2 tested whether socially excluded (relative to included) participants would anticipate reading preference consistent information to be more pleasant than preference inconsistent information, which in turn should increase the exhibition of the confirmation bias."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"previous work showed that ego depletion increased self-reports of physical tiredness (baumeister, bratlavsky, muraven, & tice, 1998; muraven, tice, & baumeister, 1998)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"because of its appealing properties for the self, depleted individuals should anticipate preference consistent (relative to preference inconsistent pieces of information to be particularly pleasant in that reading them might counteract the tiring effects of depletion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"in sum, we expected the effect of social exclusion on the exhibition of the confirmation bias to be mediated by differences in ratings of pleasantness of reading preference consistent and preference inconsistent information."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"in contrast, preference consistent pieces of information have positive implications for the self."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"thus, to avoid the exhibition of the confirmation bias, one needs self-regulation resources."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"social exclusion has been shown to lead to reduced self-regulation resources (baumeister et al., 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"therefore, we expected excluded, relative to included, participants to be more willing to search for preference consistent information and less willing to search for preference inconsistent information (i.e., the exhibition of the confirmation bias)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"it is important to note that social exclusion does not decrease the capability to control one's impulses, but rather the willingness to regulate the self (baumeister et al., 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"given a motivating reason to self-regulate, it appears that excluded participants are well capable of self regulation"
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"in this regard, recent evidence revealed that socially excluded individuals became willing to self-regulate if the self-regulation task was linked to the prospect of acceptance (dewall, baumeister, & vohs, 2008)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"likewise, social exclusion generally decreases prosocial behavior (twenge et al., 2007) but increases prosocial behavior toward a person with whom an interaction is anticipated (maner, dewall, baumeister, & schaller, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"thus, if the decision paradigm is framed in a way so that avoiding the exhibition of the confirmation bias is a way to gain acceptance, then socially excluded participants might search for preference consistent and preference inconsistent information in a balanced way."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,such a reversal of the present findings would further support the idea that the effect of social exclusion on confirmatory information processing is due to a mechanism that has motivational roots.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,one may have expected that the effects of social exclusion on the exhibition of the confirmation bias would be mediated by emotional reactions.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"because inducing negative mood increases the confirmation bias (jonas et al., 2006), it was conceivable that excluded participants could experience emotional distress, which in turn would lead to a greater exhibition of the confirmation bias."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"moreover, when controlling for reported mood, the effect of social exclusion on the confirmation bias remained unaffected."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"likewise, in the present studies, reported mood could not account for the effect of social exclusion on the confirmation bias."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"a second possible alternative explanation might be that the primary effect of social exclusion is to threaten people's ego (i.e., positive evaluations of self)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"that is, the present results could be due to ego threat, which in turn might increase the bias toward preference confirmation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"first, as noted in the introduction, previous research has shown that induced ego threat did not increase the confirmation bias (dawson et al., 2002; denes-raj & epstein, 1994; dunegan, 1993; fischer et al., 2008)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"second, past research revealed that the effects of social exclusion on selfregulation failure were not simply due to the fact that exclusion is a negative outcome."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"unlike the excluded participants, these negative feedback recipients did not respond with decreased prosocial behavior."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,the present research presented evidence that social exclusion increased the exhibition of the confirmation bias.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"in fact, an additional study showed that participants who recalled a social exclusion experience were more likely to strive for consistency (e.g., showed enhanced tendencies to like individuals who shared their opinions) relative to those who recalled a neutral experience."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"thus, social exclusion may increase not only the exhibition of the confirmation bias but also people's general reluctance to revise initial decisions, judgments, and expectations, such as the tendency to persist with or even intensify losing courses of action (i.e., escalation of commitment)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"thus, the social nature of this task may have influenced the effects of the social exclusion manipulation on confirmatory information processing."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"for instance, williams and colleagues have found that social exclusion experiences are associated with lower levels of self-esteem, belonging, control, and meaningful existence (e.g., jamieson, harkins, & williams, 2010; for on overview, williams, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"because social exclusion leads to an enhanced search for preference consistent information while neglecting preference inconsistent information, potential risks may be overlooked."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"in fact, previous research revealed that a failure to consider conflicting information can impair effective decision making (janis, 1982; kray & galinsky, 2003; nemeth & rogers, 1996)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf36.pdf,"thus, in concert with previous research (baumeister, twenge, & nuss, 2002) showing that social exclusion leads to impaired logical reasoning, the present research suggests that excluding individual decision makers might lower decision quality."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,together these findings provide evidence to suggest that various forms of intergroup discrimination can facilitate increased levels of belonging and that threats to belonging can facilitate increased levels of intergroup discrimination.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"additionally, the sct (turner, et al., 1997) proposes that the display of intergroup discrimination may be a form of social identity management."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"first, despite the results of our manipulation checks which indicate equivalent levels of identity and de personal is ation it remains possible that the participants in the experimental condition experienced increased salience of group membership compared to participants in the control condition."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,participants in the experimental condition might have had increased group salience due to the discrimination task in the experimental condition.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,this therefore could have increased salience of the in group out group dichotomy for participants in the experimental condition and not the control condition and might have increased salience of group belonging.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,increased salience of ingroup membership could have increased thoughts about the group or belonging to the group for participants in the experimental condition.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"it is 20 therefore possible that increased salience of group membership in the experimental condition might have caused belonging to increase following the discrimination task rather than intergroup discrimination causing belonging to increase, as was predicted (see hogg, turner, nascimento schulze & spriggs, 1986; turner et al., 1987)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"previous research by struch and schwartz (1988) has found that evaluation biases are uncorrelated to more negative forms of discrimination (see also abrams & hogg, 1998; amiot & bourhis, 2005; brown, 1995; hunter et al., 2011)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,this stated that the display of this negative form of intergroup discrimination towards outgroup members would enhance belonging.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,this hypothesis stated that the display of intergroup discrimination would enhance belonging.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"the findings of study 2 replicate and expand on those reported in study 1, showing that discrimination enhances belonging with respect to (a) a non-american outgroup (i.e."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,taken together the results from studies 1 and 2 indicate that belonging increases after both the display of in group out group evaluations and a more negative form of discrimination (i.e.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,this suggests that the increases in belonging shown in the experimental group of study 2 are not a simple function of drawing the participants' attention to their group membership in comparison to another group.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,these findings are supportive in so far as they indicate that belonging increases following two distinct forms of intergroup discrimination (i.e.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"whilst such findings are encouraging 29 with respect to belonging as an outcome of intergroup discrimination, recent research has also indicated that level of belonging might affect the degree to which people discriminate."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"in the last decade, various research has revealed that there is increased discrimination and aggression following social rejection (e.g."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"moreover, several studies have shown that threatened belonging (manipulated via ostracism, rejection, or peripheral group membership) leads to increased discrimination, and have hypothesised that low belonging might be the cause (e.g."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,the present studies have so far shown that participants experienced an increase in belonging following discrimination.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,hypothesis 2 states that threatened or lowered belonging would increase intergroup discrimination.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"participants in the control condition also allocated resources to ingroup and outgroup members, but they were constrained to show parity in allocations (i.e., forced to allocate the same amount to ingroup and outgroup members)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"because the data obtained using the 100 second white noise allocation task violates the assumptions underlying analysis of variance (anova; see howell, 1987; roberts & russo, 1999) we transformed our data using the arcsine transformation (howell, 1987)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"however, intergroup discrimination was clearly more pronounced in the ostracism condition."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"those who were given and took the opportunity to show intergroup discrimination) experienced an increase in belonging following the completion of the discrimination task (m = 9.95, sd = 2.31 to m = 10.98, sd = 2.00), t(76) = 5.23, p < .0005, η2 = .27)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,the first hypothesis stated that the display of intergroup discrimination (against americans) would enhance belonging.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,the second stated that low or threatened belonging would enhance intergroup discrimination.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"participants that were ostracised displayed approximately three times more differentiation between ingroup and outgroup members, with more white noise being assigned to the outgroup."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"the findings from study 3 replicate and extend the findings from studies 1 and 2. new zealanders who allocated more white noise to members of the outgroup (i.e., americans) than to members of the ingroup, experienced elevated levels of belonging."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"new zealanders who were ostracised experienced decreased belonging and showed enhanced levels (approximately three times more) of intergroup differentiation (i.e., the allocation of more white noise to outgroup than ingroup members) compared to participants who were included."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"moreover, this study found that threatened belonging (i.e., lowered levels of belonging following discrimination) can lead to increased levels of discrimination, and that such discrimination can then lead to a restoration of previously lowered belonging3."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,the present studies sought to elucidate the role that belonging might play as both a motivator and a result of intergroup discrimination.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,these three studies collectively found that belonging was enhanced after intergroup discrimination.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"additionally, threatened belonging was associated with increased discrimination, which was then associated with increased belonging."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"for example, the sct states that being categorised as a group member is sufficient impetus in itself for ingroup bias to occur (turner, 1985)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"if this is the case, participants' discrimination could be considered as being normative group behaviour."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"alternatively, according to the odt, participants' discrimination in evaluation and allocation tasks could be viewed as maintaining ingroup inclusion (i.e., the new zealand national group) while simultaneously defining this membership as distinct from the american or asian groups (i.e."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"the findings from study 3 are consistent with past research, which has found that those who are on the periphery or ostracised from their group show increased forms of prejudice (gaertner et al., 2008; jetten et al., 2002; noel et al., 1995; williams, et al."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,the present findings extend the existing research by suggesting that it is lowered belonging per se that was associated with intergroup discrimination.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"in study 3, participants who were ostracised prior to the discrimination task experienced a decrease in belonging."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"past researchers who have investigated the impact of ostracism propose that when belonging is threatened individuals act to restore their need to belong (williams, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,this is consistent 44 with williams' (2007) prediction that individuals who are ostracised from their own social group might restore lost belonging by displaying discrimination.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"of the two corollaries of the seh, greater empirical support has been found for the first corrollary, that discrimination leads to increased self-esteem, compared to the second corollary, that lowered self-esteem would lead to increased belonging (e.g., aberson et al., 2000, abrams & hogg, 1988, rubin & hewstone, 1998)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"however, in study 2 participants in the control condition did experience a decrease in self-esteem following the discrimination task, which is consistent with branscombe and wann's (1994) finding."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,branscombe and wann (1994) found that discriminating against a group that is not considered a threat to the ingroup can lead to lowered self-esteem.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"similar to this finding, when the control participants in study 2 were constrained to show parity in their white noise allocation, they also demonstrated a decrease in selfesteem."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,there are two possible reasons which may explain the observed decrease in self-esteem following the white noise allocation task.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"in study 3, belonging was lowered by the ostracism manipulation, and in all three studies, belonging was repeatedly enhanced following the discrimination tasks."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,this finding suggests that social ostracism leads to a decrease in group belonging and that intergroup discrimination can lead to an increase in group belonging.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"third, that by measuring belonging before self-esteem meant that the participants' ""motivational needs"" were already satisfied so self-esteem became somewhat irrelevant."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"fourth, as we propose, 46 that self-esteem has thus far been over-implicated as a motivation of prejudice, and that past ambivalent findings for the role of self-esteem are not best explained by erroneous measurement (e.g."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"instead, in light of the current findings, we posit that belonging better explains the underlying motivations of intergroup discrimination than self-esteem."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"however, in the current studies, self-esteem did not decrease following the ostracism manipulation, and self-esteem did not increase following the discrimination tasks."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"if self-esteem were a reflection or close relation of belonging, as has been alleged (leary & downs, 1995), then self-esteem would have been expected to either increase with belonging, or be highly associated with belonging, neither of which was found."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"this implies that future research into the motivations of intergroup discrimination should be directed towards understanding the phenomenon of belonging, rather than self-esteem."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"however, there are a 47 number of possible extraneous or associated variables, such as identity or salience, that might be obscuring a significant correlation between discrimination and belonging, or better account for the relationship between belonging and discrimination."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"moreover, it is also possible that discrimination per se does not lead to enhanced belonging."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"if discrimination is not solely, or even primarily, responsible for increases in belonging, an alternative explanation of what caused an increase in belonging needs to be explored."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"in their research investigating self-esteem and intergroup discrimination, oakes and turner (1980) theorised that it might be the salience of group membership, and not discrimination, that triggers increases in selfesteem."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"in line with this theory, the present discrimination tasks and belonging measures may have increased participants' awareness and salience of their group membership, thereby stimulating feelings of group belonging which emerged in the reported increased belonging following discrimination."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,consequently it is difficult to tease apart the impact of group membership salience on increased belonging.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"lalonde (2002) argues the absence of a correlation between belonging and discrimination might arise in circumstances where collective identity is salient, as 48 group level judgments (as regards ingroup and outgroup members) are activated."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"perceptions of ingroup variability are proposed to be attenuated and any association between identity and intergroup discrimination is likely to be small or moderate (lalonde, 2002)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"this is further exacerbated since collective identity is a multidimensional concept, with belonging, strength of identity and de personal is ation being only three aspects of this concept.. it is therefore possible that our measures might have missed some other important parts of collective identity."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"another possible explanation of, or a contributing factor to, the display of intergroup discrimination and the increase in belonging, is normative group behaviour."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"in addition, perceiving oneself as a group member is thought to activate normative behaviours (turner, 1985)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"if participants (i.e., members of the new zealand national group) considered intergroup discrimination to be a normative and acceptable response, they might discriminate to behave in the normative way."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"furthermore, participants who perceive intergroup discrimination as being normative and acceptable could experience increases in their belonging as a result of behaving in the way they consider to be normatively appropriate."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"what is more, the ingroup and outgroup manipulations that are commonly used in intergroup research necessarily draw attention to ingroup membership, which increases group salience and activates group norms."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"despite the methodological difficulties of measuring and manipulating belonging, it can be concluded that 49 intergroup discrimination lead to increased belonging, and ostracism lead to greater amounts of intergroup discrimination."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"it also remains unknown whether discrimination might lead to increased belonging in other sorts of meaningful groups, such as those based on religion, gender, or sports teams."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,the results demonstrated that new zealanders engaged in discrimination towards these two different national outgroups and experienced increased belonging as a result.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"the role of salience, as previously mentioned, is difficult to manipulate in an experimental condition that necessarily draws attention to group membership and the ingroup outgroup 50 dichotomy."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"however, future studies could manipulate group norms to address the role of normative responding in intergroup discrimination tasks."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"for example, by providing participants with descriptions of a ""typical group member's behaviour"" or directly informing participants of behaviour that is ""normal"" for their group, we would expect behaviour to change in response to the norms presented."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"one way in which this might be done could be by informing participants that their group tended to show ingroup favouritism, parity, or outgroup bias prior to a discrimination task (see jetten, spears & manstead, 1996)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,thus with a norm such as fairness we would expect that a display of fairness might lead to increased belonging.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"norms of ingroup favouritism, which might currently exist for new zealanders, would be expected to generate intergroup discrimination."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"what is more, if behaviour is mainly driven by following norms, then belonging should enhance via showing normative behaviour."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"the current studies found that participants experienced enhanced belonging following the display of various forms of discrimination, and lowered belonging led to greater amounts of discrimination."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"together these three experiments 51 have generated the first empirical evidence showing discrimination enhances belonging, and that threatened belonging leads to increased intergroup discrimination."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,the findings from the first two studies indicated that the process of discriminating against another national group plays a role in elevating the sense of belonging to your national group.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"the findings from study 3 further indicated that individuals who have threatened belonging engaged in greater amounts of negative intergroup discrimination, in order to restore their relatively diminished belonging."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,"while belonging was repeatedly found in this experiment to increase following intergroup discrimination, it is not yet possible to assert that belonging is the only motivational need involved in intergroup discrimination."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,there are also a number of other possible motives that may moderate or mediate the display of intergroup discrimination.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/bitstream_10839.pdf,further research into these areas is needed if the motivational basis of intergroup discrimination is to be understood and the negative impacts of prejudice and discrimination are to be reduced.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,follow-up contrasts indicated that ostracized adolescents who wrote about friends worked more for food points and consumed more food than other adolescents.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"conclusion results suggest that social connection related activities following ostracism may further deplete self-regulatory resources, thereby resulting in increased unhealthy food patterns."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"studies consistently show that single episodes of ostracism are extremely stressful, as indexed by both self-report and physiological measures of stress and reactivity (e.g., eisenberger, lieberman, & williams, 2003; zadro, williams, & richardson, 2004) and can negatively impact self-esteem and cognition (e.g., boyes & french, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"the effect of ostracism appears to be so powerful, in part, because ostracism undermines fundamental acceptance and belonging needs, which in turn, leads to negative behavioral and psychological reactions (williams, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"recent research indicates that brief episodes of ostracism can also lead to increased consumption of energy dense, unhealthy food (baumesiter, dewall, ciarocco & twenge, 2005; baumeister, wall, ciarocco, & twenge, 2005; oaten, williams, jones, & zadro, 2008; oliver, huon, zadro, & williams, 2001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"in addition, recent research suggests that such negative interpersonal experiences as peer rejection, peer exclusion, and ostracism evoke threat responses and impair self-regulatory and control processes (baumeister, twenge, & nuss, 2002; baumeister et al., 2005; dewall, baumeister, stillman, & gailliot, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"thus, one explanation for why unhealthy eating occurs after ostracism is that ostracism impairs the self-monitoring and self-regulatory processes that are needed for dietary restraint."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"the authors posit that although social exclusion may thwart needs to belong, simply being reminded about social connections may help to restore these needs and thereby diminish aggressive and other negative, dysregulated threat responses."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"in another recent study, gross (2009) found that individuals who interacted with unfamiliar peers following computer simulated ostracism recovered more quickly psychologically than individuals who did not have any social interaction."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"yet, given the negative physical and psychological health costs of unhealthy eating, understanding the associations between ostracism, eating, and social connection activities could inform etiological theories and improve prevention and intervention efforts."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"thus, it seems likely that episodes of ostracism may lead to unhealthy eating patterns not only during adulthood, but also during early adolescence."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"also, similar to adults, social connection related activities may decrease the likelihood of negative, dysregulated responses after ostracism among young adolescents."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"this study is guided by recent theory and research suggesting that increased motivation to eat unhealthy foods and increased consumption of these foods may reflect and be measures of self-regulatory failure (baumeister et al., 2005; oaten et al., 2008; oliver et al., 2001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"more specifically, it is argued that because the over consumption of unhealthy snack foods is widely recognized as a contributing factor to the worldwide obesity epidemic, and because people are attracted to palatable energy dense foods and must therefore overcome their desire to eat, curtailing or inhibiting 24 salvy et al."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"initial analyses indicated that ostracized participants showed higher motivation for obtaining snack food during an operant computer task than participants who were in the included control condition, although there were no cyberball condition differences in actual food intake."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,the most novel findings of this study were that young adolescents who were ostracized and wrote about their friends responded more for food during the operant task and consumed more snack food than adolescents who were engaged in other activities.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"conceivably, the writing activity was more likely to induce affective states than the other activities of watching documentaries and solving puzzles, which are usually considered emotionally neutral activities."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"both positive and negative moods have been shown to increase eating compared to neutral mood (patel & schlundt, 2001), which may lead to the expectation that emotional distress reactivity mediated the association between ostracism and motivation to eat and food consumption."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"it is also plausible that ostracism increases accessibility of negative social memories, which is similar to social information processing theory and models (crick & dodge, 1996; lemerise & arsenio, 2000), which in turn, led to heightened negative responses."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"in either case, ostracism and threat detection would cause both attention and effort to be simultaneously drawn toward social cues, especially for adolescents who are primed to think about their friend and away from the self-monitoring and self-regulatory processes needed for dietary restraint."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"on the other hand, engaging in activities that do not require a considerable amount of cognitive attention or effort, such as watching television, might protect regulatory resources compared to cognitively demanding tasks such as completing puzzles or engaging in a writing exercise."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"additional research is needed, but it is clear that the socioemotional component of the writing exercise uniquely contributed to our findings independently from the effects of executive control."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"of course, it is also plausible that the lack of commercials, the subject of the video, or some other unique aspects of our ''tv'' activity may have impacted the study findings and that should be considered in future research."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"second, the use of a between-subject design limits our interpretation of the results as there were no direct comparisons of the impact of ostracism and activity types within the same participant."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"however, as we were designing the study, we deemed that carry-over effects (from being exposed to either the ostracism or inclusion condition first) would potentially influence the findings of the experiment."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"finally, as with any choice experiment, the choice of alternatives undoubtedly influenced the results, and it is likely that providing different alternatives to eating may have resulted in different patterns of responding and eating behavior."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"for instance, there is growing evidence that young adolescents not only interact differently with friends and non friends unfamiliar peers, but also that they think differently about their friends and that friends are uniquely influential on psychosocial growth and development (e.g., burgess, wojslawowicz, rubin, rosekrasnor, & booth-laforce, 2006; rubin et al., 2006)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"thus, having the possibility to interact with an actual friend may have been a more powerful alternative than eating or socializing with an unfamiliar peer, and should be considered for future research pertaining to ostracism and eating during early adolescence."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"together with the our previous findings, results from this study strongly suggest that ostracism may perpetuate unhealthy behavior in some youth by increasing their motivation to eat and energy intake (salvy et al., 2011)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"results further suggest that the impact of young adolescents' activity type and coping strategies following ostracism play a more critical role than has been acknowledged, and that certain activities postostracism, such as social connection related activities, may promote the continuance of unhealthy eating in young adolescents."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"indeed, our findings suggest that surmising about a social problem while thinking about one's friend may ''backfire'' and imperil further behavioral control during early adolescence."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/jsr066.pdf,"instead, it appears that young adolescents who are experiencing problematic peer relations and who are at risk for impairment in self-regulation may benefit from engaging in nonsocial, less taxing, mind-occupying strategies that allow them to regain behavioral control such as cognitive distraction, thought stopping or selective attention (kendall & braswell, 1993)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"in a coactive task, group members work on the same task but produce individual, tangible outputs; usually, each member is rewarded based on her/his contribution (williams & sommer, 1997)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,this will allow me to test hypotheses regarding the target's effort and the possibility that the effort is motivated by a desire to seek revenge on the group in the form of sabotaging group performance.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"on the one hand, targets may be motivated to satisfy their need to belong and will contribute more to the group task to gain the attention and respect of other members (baumeister & leary, 1995)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"this phenomenon is called social compensation; in this instance, targets attempt to remedy their sense of exclusion by maximizing their effort in tasks that benefit the group (williams & karau, 1991)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"on the other hand, targets may feel distant from and lose interest in promoting the group, and thereby reject or punish those who have rejected them (williams & sommer, 1997)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"in this case, the target is self-focused, trying to 15 maximize her/his goals and exerting less effort for the group if it does not add any value to her/his individual goals."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"in one of the first studies on this subject, williams and sommer (1997) find that ostracized females socially compensate, whereas ostracized males engage in social loafing."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"these results indicate that targets react differently in a group task based on the nature and purpose of the task, as well as their own needs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"because there is no research on group performance in conditions of partial ostracism, it is not clear how predictions for full ostracism will hold in the context of partial ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"in another experiment, participants are excluded by not being given the information for a group discussion, a form of partial exclusion, which leads to a lower level of need satisfaction (jones et al."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,it seems that task type and how the target perceives the act of ostracism affect how much effort s/he is willing to exert in the group task.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"since task type will be constant in this study, the target's attribution will shape her/his effort."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"if the target feels that group members are unfair and exclude her/him for no good reason, s/he will be more willing to take revenge on the group and sabotage group performance."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"this is consistent with the theoretical framework proposed by smart richman and leary (2009), indicating that when targets perceive ostracism as unfair, they are more likely to engage in antisocial behaviours."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"when the target perceives the relationship as repairable, however, s/he will engage more in pro-social behaviours and less in antisocial acts (smart richman & leary, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"put differently, when the target attributes ostracism internally and as a punitive act, s/he is likely to try to repair the relationship by increasing her/his effort to compensate for her/his mistake."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,jones and kelley (2010) show that excluded targets have lower liking of group members.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"as the target loses interest in the group and working with the group, s/he will not be willing to put forth effort for the group."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,the concomitant reduced liking of the group and group members will result in a withdrawal of effort.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"but as activity exclusion decreases, group membership becomes rewarding and the target is willing to make an effort for the group."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,their study shows that the pain associated with recalling loneliness stimulates participants' need to connect with others to avoid the recurrence of loneliness.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"in other words, the higher the activity exclusion, the greater the threat to the target's needs and the greater the need for the target to reconnect and find social support; hence, the target will help others more."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"as the number of ostracizers increases, the target will feel a higher level of threat to her/his basic needs and start to satisfy them outside the group, resulting in more pro-social behaviours."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"the threat to basic needs should be diminished when the target is included in a certain amount of group activity; similarly, the desire to help another individual should be reduced when the target is included in a certain amount of group activity."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,gender was again used as a control since poulsen's (2006) work shows that women make more internal attributions than men when ostracized.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"rejection sensitivity is another fixed attribute and was controlled for since people with high rejection sensitivity, expect rejection and react strongly to it (downey & feldman, 1996)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"based on this theory, the impact of others on an individual depends on their proximity, their power/status and the number of others involved."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,targets may have worked hard not because they cared about group performance but to get the money.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,helping hypotheses hypothesis 9 predicts that the relationship between helping and activity exclusion is mediated by the amount of threat to participants' basic needs.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"as expected, there is a positive significant relationship between the participants' activity exclusion and their desire to help another student (!"
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"however this relationship is not mediated by the threat to basic needs, as the relationship between threat to needs and helping a fellow student is not significant."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"in terms of internal attribution, we know that people exclusion is not related to internal attribution, while activity exclusion is negatively related (hypotheses 2 and 3)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"as a result, it can be concluded that the effect of activity exclusion is stronger in determining how targets make sense of their ostracism experience (!"
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,the threat to basic needs is significantly related to both activity exclusion and people exclusion.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"the results show that activity exclusion still explains variations in threats to basic needs above and beyond people exclusion, while people exclusion drops to non-significant after 35 considering activity exclusion."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"as evident by the graph, at high levels of activity exclusion, people exclusion mattered more for the amount of threats targets feel."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"in other words, when activity exclusion was low, meaning that when targets were included in a majority of activities, they felt more threat to their needs when all group members treated them the same versus when only one group member included them."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"as targets got more and more excluded from group activities, they felt higher threat when more people excluded them."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"one explanation might be that as people age, they gain confidence and self-esteem and, consequently, less frequently attribute negative work-related events to themselves."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"they do not view negative behaviours at work as an indication of their lack of competency; rather, they look to the situation or other involved parties for an explanation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"the results of study 2 indicate that contrary to predictions, as activity exclusion increases, targets make fewer internal attributions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"since the experience of ostracism is painful (williams, 2007), targets tend to associate it externally to avoid personal responsibility for the painful experience."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"and as they experience more inclusion, they attribute it more to themselves."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"as noted, in full ostracism the signs point to the target, as the reason for ostracism is clearer than in partial ostracism, thereby reducing the self-serving bias."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"however, due to its vague nature, in cases of partial ostracism, the target can interpret the events more freely, resulting in a biased interpretation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"participants may not care about who is throwing the ball to them; as long as they receive the ball, they are satisfied."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"although the manipulation check showed that targets realized who threw them the ball, they may not have expected to receive ball equally from everyone."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,the change in the number of players throwing the ball may not be related to how targets attribute ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"both hypotheses about threats to basic needs were supported, indicating that any form of partial ostracism or change in any of dimension of partial ostracism will lead to threats on basic needs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,hypothesis 4 also provides a mechanism for explaining why activity exclusion affects threats to basic needs.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"as a target's activity exclusion increases, s/he makes more external attributions, blaming the situation on other group members; as a result, s/he feels a greater threat to her/his needs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"in other words, as activity exclusion increases, the target feels less in control and perceives the situation as out of her/his hands, resulting in the perception of a greater threat to her/his needs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"due to this attribution, the target does not know how to change the situation in her/his favour; hence, her/his self-esteem, belonging, meaningful existence and control are increasingly threatened."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"as expected, rejection sensitivity was positively and significantly related to threats to basic needs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"again, more women than men felt their needs were threatened after ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"this is an interesting finding, indicating that women's needs in general are more easily threatened."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"the more people ostracizing the target, the greater the threat to the target's basic needs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"the control variable of rejection sensitivity was again significant, supporting the idea that the more sensitive the target is to rejection, the more s/he will feel the threat."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"these findings highlight the contradictory results of previous research showing that ostracism can 40 lead to social loafing or social compensation (williams & sommer, 1997)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"if participants did not consider this a group task, their performance may have been unaffected by their ostracism experience."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"the results might have been different if the feeling of working in a group were manipulated more strongly, although the fact that the same task showed the predicted effect in the next hypothesis weakens this suspicion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"furthermore, there is a marginally significant relationship between effort and the amount of money targets take for themselves, indicating that targets who have assigned themselves more money as a reward or a pay-off are willing to work harder on the task, regardless of their activity exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"hypothesis 7 was supported, indicating that as the number of ostracizers (people exclusion) increases, the target expends less effort in the group task."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"again, participants who allocated a larger reward to themselves put forth more effort, indicating that the effort may have been exerted for self-gain rather than group gain."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,this increases the suspicion that the group task was not strong enough to create group involvement.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,increase in the activity exclusion made targets more willing to help another undergraduate student.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,this is consistent with the prediction that helping and pro-social behaviour are ways of becoming connected to others.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"when the target has not met this need in a group setting, s/he can fulfil it elsewhere, for example, by helping a fellow undergraduate (in 41 group) outside the group context."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"even when they lack connections elsewhere, they do not see graduate students as potential friends."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"another explanation may be the fact that the researcher was a graduate student, and the targets may have resented her for putting them through this experience, leading them to refuse to help another graduate student."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,hence targets may have been more willing to volunteer for the former than latter.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"the results of this study's previous hypotheses indicate that when considered separately, each dimension has a significant effect on the outcome variables."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"interestingly, people exclusion only matters when a group task is at stake."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,the target will not put forth an effort for the group if s/he does not feel accepted by all her/his peers.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"to summarize, activity exclusion is a better predictor of individual42 based outcomes and group satisfaction, and the number of group members interacting with the target matters when it comes to performing for a group goal."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"when targets were included in a majority of activities, they felt more threat to their needs when all group members were excluding them to some extent than when two group members fully excluded them."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"when all inclusion is provided by one group member (the case of two ostracizers), the target may count on that person more for support."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"when the same amount of attention is divided among three, the target has more people to turn to but all those links are weak and hence less reliable e.g."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"when activity exclusion increases, the attention is so scarce that not only does activity inclusion become important but also how many people provide it becomes critical."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,the non-ostracizer can easily become an ostracizer) as a result targets would rather to have more of these weak ties to ensure that they are included to some extend in case one or two non-ostracizers decide to become ostracizers.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,the existence of this interaction highlights the fact that targets realized how many people included and excluded them.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,combining experiment data with field data ensures depth and causality of the findings and makes the results more generalizable.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,results provide evidence that partial ostracism occurs more frequently in real life than full ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,based on these findings we know that activity exclusion affects how targets make internal attribution.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"the more targets are excluded from activities, the more they would attribute it to external factors."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"as expected, targets feel threat to their needs when either activity exclusion or people exclusion are present."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"similarly, both dimensions affect the amount of liking of group."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"to summarize, now we know that both dimensions of partial ostracism affect outcomes of interest."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"for a target to have well-being and group satisfaction s/he should be included to a certain level; however, if the target is expected to put forth an effort, all group members should interact with her/him."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"in other words, activity exclusion provides personal benefits to the target, and people exclusion provides group performance benefits."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"in other words the results show that in situations when both activity exclusion and people exclusion are present people's threat to needs, attribution and group commitment are more affected by the amount of activity exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,the results show that even partial ostracism will lead to negative outcomes.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"second, the results give managers ways to counter the negative effects of partial ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"knowing how much activity exclusion matters to employees' well being, managers can make sure no employee is left alone in a group setting by matching employees."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,having a friend or mentor makes the work environment more pleasant for someone who is ostracized.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"mentors ensure that targets of ostracism are not fully disconnected from the organization; put another way, targets have some professional and emotional connection with the organization through their mentors."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,attributing a negative event in the workplace externally removes blame from the target.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"as a result, the target will feel there is nothing s/he can do to change the situation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"knowing that her/his efforts will be useless, the target will withdraw from the situation and accept the ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,this inactivity can lead to severe negative outcomes as it lets the ostracism continue.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,managers cannot assume these negative behaviours will be resolved on their own; they must take action by addressing any such behaviour in the group.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"fourth, the results show that targets of partial ostracism will work harder for the group if they get attention from all group members."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"hence, even if managers cannot eliminate partial ostracism, they can add to group productivity by creating 46 more interdependent jobs, thereby ensuring that all group members are connected and interacting on one or two tasks."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"while it seems that the effect of partial ostracism is large enough to be detected with a relatively small sample, the failure to find an effect in some hypotheses can be due to the sample size."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"for instance, it is hard for targets to come up with attributions over an on-line ball tossing game, as there is little information to make the inference."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"in the face-to-face game, participants can get more cues from their group mates."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"such analyses will provide richer data, as the experimenter will be able to videotape participants' reactions, facial gestures and eye contact and measure efforts to bond."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"future research can make the group situations more dynamic, for instance, by looking at how ostracizers react to targets 48 and non ostracize rs how non-ostracizers react when they are ignored or punished by the ostracizers, or how targets treat the non-ostracizers if the ostracizers include them."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"the nature of the task can be changed as well, asking targets to become involved in another on-line game with a specific mission."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"as mentioned above, the task and group activity may make a difference in results."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,at least their pay and performance evaluations are dependent upon their ability to do so.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"in the workplace, people know they will have repeated interactions with their co-workers and as a result may use different coping strategies when faced with aggression or ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"in study 2, although targets did not choose with whom they played, they knew that it was a short term interaction and their pay or promotion was not dependent upon their performance ."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"as a result, their interpretation of ostracism, their reactions to it, and their effort toward the group might have differed."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,different 49 conditions and different attributes and reactions of ostracizers and targets will shape the non ostracize rs ' decisions.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"in one of a very few studies on observers, wesselmann wirth, pryor and williams (2007) show that non-ostracizers always over-include targets even when the target is stigmatized."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"in a follow-up study, they show that nonostracizers join ostracism only when they can rationalize the act of ostracism (wesselmann, wirth, pryor, reeder, & williams, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"results of attribution might have been moderated by targets' locus of control, and any non-significant effect may be due to this distinction."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"when the activity exclusion or people exclusion are the same, targets with more internal locus of control may more often attribute ostracism internally than those with external locus of control."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,another demographic change could be the proportion of non-ostracizers and ostracizers.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"future studies could change this, considering the willingness of the target to join the non-ostracizers and ostracizers and the non ostracize rs ' desire to follow the ostracizers."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"as my groups constituted only four people, it was not possible to have more than one ostracizer and minority partial ostracism at the same time."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"future research can increase the group size, study minority partial ostracism and evaluate how reactions change as the number of 50 ostracizers compared to the number of non-ostracizers changes from minority to equal to majority."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,one interesting result of study 1 was the fact that targets were more often ostracized by co-workers than by superiors.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"first, past research has shown that ostracism, even by a non-reputable group, is hurtful (gonsalkorale & williams, 2007), so ostracism by anyone from any rank in the organization is painful for the target."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,one can argue that peers may use ostracism more as a punitive tool while supervisors may use it for corrective reasons.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"second, as superiors have other means to show their disapproval, it seems logical that peers, with fewer options, choose ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"on the other hand, the more powerful the source of ostracism, the greater may be the harm associated with it."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"because ostracism deprives the target from resources, the higher the rank of the source or her/his power, the bigger and more critical the resources denied to the target."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,another way in which power and ostracism can interact is through coalition formation.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"while ostracism by a subordinate may not be very effective, if subordinates form a coalition and ostracize a powerful superior or peer in the group, the effect would be much larger."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"in other words, powerless individuals can form coalitions to become powerful and deprive the opponent from useful resources through ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"in other words, the change in people exclusion from 1 to 2 should be matched with a similar level of change in activity exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"for instance, a temporal lens can be used so that help may be granted if requested by the target after s/he has recovered from the initial shock of ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"as williams (2007) indicates, targets' responses change as time elapses from the incident of ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"while phases 1 and 2 are immediate, phase 3 happens at least few minutes after the ostracism when the target is better able to analyze and respond properly."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"hence, if targets are asked to offer help to a charity, they should be able to distinguish between those in need and the sources of their ostracism if they are in the third stage."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"arguably, if the target is given a chance to get even with the ostracizers, such as the group task opportunity in this study, s/he will be able to calm down and treat the helping situation as a separate event."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"if not, the target may take revenge on the party requiring 52 help."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,such a focus would be helpful in explaining why some people carry their workrelated anger and frustration home and punish friends and family.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,"in a 4-person group a target would get 25% attention of the whole group is s/he is treated fairly, hence exclusion of 25% indicates full ostracism."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,supported hypothesis 8: the amount of target liking for a group mediates the relationships between (a) activity exclusion and the effort a target exerts toward a group task and (b) people exclusion and the effort a target exerts toward a group task.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Banki_Sara_201206_PhD_thesis.pdf,another less extreme example of ostracism is that only some of your group members may avoid you and not interact with you while others act normally toward you.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"realistic participants and unrealistically pessimistic participants who were self-affirmed expressed relatively less interest in crc screening, suggesting that self affirmation can be helpful or hurtful depending on the accuracy of one's risk perceptions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"nih-pa author manuscript nih-pa author manuscript nih-pa author manuscript people tend to exhibit unrealistic optimism about their chances of experiencing a wide variety of health conditions (harris, griffin, & murray, 2008; helweg-larsen & shepperd, 2001; weinstein, 1980, 1987)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,we define unrealistic optimism here as the mistaken belief that one's own chances of experiencing a health problem are relatively lower than the chances of other people.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"some research shows that unrealistically optimistic individuals have more risk factors and are less cognizant of those risk factors (davidson & prkachin, 1997; dillard, mccaul, & klein, 2006; radcliffe & klein, 2002; wiebe & black, 1997; for review, see klein & cooper, 2008), suggesting this bias could be consequential."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"however, this procedure makes it impossible to identify which sample members are biased, a necessity in order to determine whether those biases are consequential."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"a given person can be identified as unrealistically optimistic if that person's perceived comparative risk is lower than that of a more objective criterion, such as comparative risk calculated from a risk algorithm."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"one could also be unrealistically optimistic about an event in a more absolute sense - e.g., believing that an event will not happen when objective factors would suggest otherwise."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"however, we focus here on the comparative definition of unrealistic optimism in part because people often think about risk in comparative terms (klein, 2003)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"unrealistic optimism can be distinguished from comparative optimism, or the belief that one's risk is lower than that of other people irrespective of the accuracy of that belief."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"because of the use of an objective criterion, the current study addresses unrealistic optimism - the mistaken belief that one's risk is lower than that of other people - and how it might be related to behavioral intentions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"individuals cling tenaciously to their optimistic beliefs by using a plethora of defensive strategies (e.g., croyle, sun, & louie, 1993; klein, 1996); as a result, unrealistic optimism is particularly resistant to change using risk communications (e.g., weinstein & klein, 1995)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"such resistance is not surprising given that risk communications often bring one's behavior into question, engaging mechanisms that reduce their impact."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"recent work suggests that if people are given the opportunity to reflect on core attributes or values in the context of threatening health feedback, they are less likely to respond defensively (sherman & cohen, 2006)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"this research is based on self affirmation theory (steele, 1988), which holds that people are more accepting of threatening information when they can sustain a general feeling of morality, integrity, and consistency."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"in one study, when drinkers read an article linking alcohol use to breast cancer and were self-affirmed in advance (by writing an essay about a core value), they were more receptive to the article and considered themselves more at risk (harris & napper, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,we reasoned that self affirmation might be particularly effective at reducing defensive responses to threatening health messages among people who are unrealistically optimistic about a health risk.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"at times, they may be unrealistically pessimistic, such as when estimating how well they might cope with negative life events (blanton, axsom, mcclive, & price, 2001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"on the one hand, selfaffirmation could have a detrimental effect by reducing concern and therefore interest in klein et al."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"indeed, self affirmation has been shown to reduce rumination and stress (koole, smeets, van knippenberg, & dijksterhuis, 1999; wiesenfeld, brockner, petzall, wolf, & bailey, 2001), suggesting it could have similar effects on unrealistically pessimistic individuals."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"conversely, self affirmation might make pessimistic individuals feel more efficacious and less fatalistic, thereby eliciting more rather than less health promotion behavior."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"however, if self affirmation has a detrimental effect, the indiscriminate use of it as an intervention tool - particularly in applied contexts with patients and other individuals who may tend to be more pessimistic - would be unjustified."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,a related question is how self affirmation influences people who view their risk more accurately.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"for such individuals, risk feedback is likely to be consistent with a priori views of their risk, making the feedback less threatening."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,recent work suggests that self affirmation can reduce interest in health promotion behavior among individuals who are not personally threatened by a persuasive health message.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"for example, van koningsbruggen and das (2009) showed that whereas high-risk members of a sample had higher intentions when self-affirmed than when not affirmed, intentions were lower among self-affirmed low-risk individuals."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,that may make sense in some contexts - low risk individuals often do not need to engage in riskreduction behavior.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"in the current context, however, where we examined individuals who were off-schedule for colorectal cancer (crc) screening (recommended for all men and women over age 50 regardless of other risk factors), the effect of self affirmation could be detrimental and thus deserves examination."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,our main hypothesis was that self affirmation would cause unrealistic optimists to express greater intentions to screen than non-affirmed unrealistic optimists (as well as the control group) in response to the feedback.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"we also examined whether unrealistic optimists who were not self-affirmed would respond defensively, i.e., express relatively lower interest in screening than controls."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"for habitual behaviors, it is difficult to establish the temporal relationship between risk perceptions and behavior (brewer, cuite, herrington, & weinstein, 2004) because behavior may alter perceptions of risk."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,interpretation is facilitated when one measures a novel behavior in a sample largely unfamiliar with the behavior.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,we used taped rather than written affirmations because we were using a community sample for which written essays could be burdensome.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,participants in the affirmation and non-affirmation conditions also received comparison information suggesting (based on the baseline interview) that they not only had several risk factors that increased their risk but that other people like them had fewer such risk factors.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,this was expected to exacerbate levels of personal threat relative to the standard (tailored) control.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"some of the quiz items were made difficult in order to create variability in the quiz scores, and thus we did not expect most participants to answer 100% correctly."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,lower perceptions of comparative risk were associated with higher likelihood of being unrealistically optimistic (r = −.38).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"these findings suggest that giving non-affirmed optimists risk factor information was associated with lower intentions to screen relative to a standard information control, consistent with a defensive posture."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"conversely, intentions to screen were higher among optimists when they had an opportunity to self-affirm."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"these data fully support our main hypothesis, and show not only that self affirmation can facilitate non-defensive processing among unrealistic optimists but that its absence in the face of threat can foster such defensive processing."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,this pattern is consistent with the idea that unrealistic optimism is not always detrimental.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"providing comparative feedback on risk factors without a self affirmation opportunity appeared to undo these otherwise beneficial effects (m = 4.08, sd = 2.26), t = 2.42, p < .01, r = .20)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"however, providing comparative feedback was associated with lower intentions to screen among non-affirmed unrealistically pessimistic individuals (m = 5.08, sd = 2.23), and intentions were even lower among those who were self-affirmed (m = 3.36, sd = 2.24), klein et al."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"all between-group differences were again significant, ts > 2.69, ps < .005, rs > .210. thus, for realists, providing social comparison information was associated with higher intentions, but less so when they were self-affirmed."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"discussion in this study, self affirmation moderated the relationship between unrealistic optimism and intentions to engage in risk-reduction practices in the context of threatening feedback."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"when unrealistically optimistic individuals were self-affirmed prior to receipt of risk factor feedback, they were more interested in screening than were non-affirmed unrealistic optimists (or even self-affirmed realists and unrealistic pessimists)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"conversely, when unrealistic optimists received the threatening information and were not self-affirmed in advance, they were relatively less interested in screening, suggesting defensive processing."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"this pattern held even when controlling for subjective risk perceptions, suggesting that unrealistic optimism explained unique variance in intentions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"among realists and unrealistic pessimists, self affirmation appeared to be less beneficial."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"thus, although self affirmation can be a potentially effective tool in health campaigns, it may need to be tailored to the audience based on their risk perceptions and perhaps other individual differences."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,these findings suggest that one should measure biases in a priori risk perceptions before offering self affirmation opportunities to recipients of a threatening health message.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"it may be fruitful to use self affirmations with high-risk populations given that such individuals are more likely to be unrealistically optimistic (radcliffe & klein, 2002; strecher, kreuter, & kobrin, 1995)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,it would appear that unrealistic optimism can be harmful or beneficial depending on available opportunities for self affirmation
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,we can surmise that unrealistic optimists in the non-affirmed condition were accessing the documented panoply of defensive strategies that people use to protect their unrealistically optimistic beliefs.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,a next step in this research is to determine whether unrealistic optimists who are self-affirmed exhibit a decrease in the accessibility of these strategies.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"self affirmation likely made these individuals act less defensively in response to the risk feedback, making them regard the feedback as more personally relevant (harris & napper, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"we have found in other work that self affirmation may also enhance implicit attention to the threatening aspects of a health message (klein & harris, in press); to the extent that this is true among unrealistic optimists, the negative effects of this bias on behavior can potentially be reversed."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,it is important that the self affirmation manipulation had the intended effect among unrealistic optimists given that we had individuals self-affirm by discussing their positive health attributes.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,this approach is easily adopted in a health setting because of high face validity (due to the focus on health) and accessibility (due to use of discussion rather than essay-writing).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"usually participants write about a completely unrelated value (mcqueen & klein, 2006) given that self affirmations in domains related to the threat can backfire (blanton, cooper, skurnick, & aronson, 1997; galinsky, stone, & cooper, 2000)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"of note, studies that demonstrate failed effects of self affirmations in related domains focus on whether selfaffirmation reduces dissonance, rather than whether it promotes less defensiveness in response to a threatening message."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"in the context of threatening messages, provoking dissonance about one's behavior while concomitantly protecting the self-concept via selfaffirmation may be the most effective approach (see also klein & monin, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,the observed pattern is also notable given the possibility that self affirmation might have been predicted to enhance self-serving biases like unrealistic optimism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"notably, selfaffirmation does not necessarily appear to exert its effects by elevating state self-esteem or positive affect (sherman & cohen, 2006), and has been shown to reduce several biases such as group-serving attributions (sherman & kim, 2005) and reinforcement of cultural worldview following mortality salience (schmeichel & martens, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"thus, it seems unlikely that self affirmation would enhance unrealistic optimism and its effects, and there is even evidence that self affirmation could be associated with less comparative bias (sherman, cohen, nelson, nussbaum, bunyan, & garcia, in press)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"in our study, selfaffirmation appeared to also dampen the negative effects of unrealistic optimism, but might also have reduced threat perceptions among individuals who are not unrealistically optimistic."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"it may be that people initially have a defensive response to threatening comparative feedback, yet become more receptive to its implications over time."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"in general, social comparison feedback has been shown to have important effects on later behavior (schmiege, klein, & bryan, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"our main focus was on intentions, not actual screening, although there is evidence that crc screening intentions are linearly and consistently associated with actual screening (e.g., mcqueen, vernon, myers, watts, lee, & tilley, 2007), and evidence that self affirmation can elicit enduring change in other health behaviors (epton & harris, 2008)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"in addition, we did not check what mechanisms were affected by the self affirmation manipulation (e.g., self-esteem, self-efficacy), in part because manipulation checks of selfaffirmation can unwittingly serve as self affirmations themselves (klein & monin, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"we also did not include a group that was self-affirmed without any threatening risk factor feedback; this design decision was predicated on previous findings showing that selfaffirmation is ineffectual or perhaps even harmful in the absence of threat (e.g., harris & napper, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"importantly, there were sufficient numbers of unrealistic optimists in each cell (approximately 20) to test our main hypothesis that selfaffirmation would have a beneficial effect on screening intentions among unrealistic optimists."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"it is important to acknowledge that health messages and risk feedback might threaten cherished aspects of the self given that people often enjoy distorted positive beliefs about themselves (taylor & brown, 1988)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"such threats, in turn, lead to defensive processing and may undermine the goals of the intervention (e.g., croyle et al., 1993; liberman & chaiken, 1992)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,"to the extent that people can believe they possess morality, consistency, and integrity, they may be more receptive to a wide variety of potentially threatening messages."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Self-Affirmation_Moderates_Effects_of_Unrealistic_.pdf,if users of self affirmation techniques are mindful of the audience - a point highlighted here by the negative effects of self affirmation on screening intentions among unrealistic pessimists and realists - previously ineffective intervention strategies may turn out to be worth another try.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"compared to nonostracized students, adolescents in the ostracism condition reported significantly lower levels of positive mood after playing the game."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,the present results from a non english speaking sample correspond well to the few earlier findings in adolescent and adult populations by suggesting that even brief periods of ostracism with unknown others can lead to a significant decrease in well-being in these age groups.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"as a subroutine of this adaptation, humans have developed a detection system sensitive to cues of being ostracized or socially excluded which is accompanied by emotionand cognition-based alarm systems."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"being ostracized is likely to produce increased sensations of pain and a decline in self-esteem (leary, 2001; macdonald & leary, 2005; williams, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"there is some evidence that sensitivity to exclusion is particularly high among adolescents as compared to younger children or adults (kloep, 1999; larson & richards, 1991), due to the increased importance placed on maintaining peer relationships in this period of life (masten et al., 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"being rejected by peers is associated with a number of adverse outcomes including depression (gazelle & ladd, 2003), lower self-esteem (leary, tambor, terdal, & downs, 1995), poor academic achievement, and dropping out of school (graham & juvonen, 1998)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"furthermore, repeated rejection by peers is associated with suicide (williams, forgas, & van hippel, 2005) and has repeatedly been identified as a common trigger for school shootings (leary, kowalski, smith, & phillips, 2003)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"the consequences of being excluded are devastating and studies using longitudinal data indicate that peer rejection has a unidirectional negative effect on psychological health in children (crick, 1996) and that peer rejection accentuates symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness in vulnerable children (nishina, juvonen, & witkow, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"in addition, peer group rejection has been found to be correlated with experiences of victimization by peers (ladd & troop-gordon, 2003), higher levels of aggression (prinstein & la greca, 2004; reijntjes et al., 2010), and social withdrawal (ollendick, greene, weist, & oswald, 1990)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"these behavioral characteristics may, in turn, play an important role in the group dynamics leading to rejection."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"combined with the highly aversive experience of victimization, they may also influence findings on the consequences of rejection."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,williams' (2007) summary of the results of experiments on adults conducted using the cyberball paradigm shows significantly more negative mood in participants subjected to ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"with regard to self-reported levels of distress, earlier findings clearly show that participants reported a markedly lowered sense of belonging, poorer self-esteem, reduced feelings of meaningful existence and control following brief periods of social exclusion (typical effect sizes, cohen's d's in the 1.0 to 2.0 range)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"studies using the cyberball paradigm even report distress following ostracism by outgroup members (also despised ones) underscoring the fundamental importance of belongingness (gonsalkorale & williams, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"she found that excluded subjects reported a lowered state of self-esteem (single-item measure) and relational value as well as higher levels of dysphoria, shame, and anger compared to included subjects."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"apparently, sex effects in response to ostracism are rather small, and strong negative responses to ostracism are found across all age categories with regard to need threats."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"this is in line with findings demonstrating that young adolescents attach great importance to the opinions and appraisals of peers (harter, 2006) and studies reporting hypersensitivity to rejection in the early adolescent period (kloep, 1999)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"however, we chose a somewhat less extreme form (students received the ball six times before being excluded) because we experienced extreme negative reactions during the piloting; students stopped playing and asked the research assistant for help."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,adolescents in the ostracism condition reported receiving the ball less often as well as feeling markedly more excluded and rejected than adolescents in the inclusion condition.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"this indicates that being ostracized clearly affected the excluded participants' mood, and that the items used were sensitive enough to detect changes in mood levels."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"third, consistent with previous research in adults and adolescents, we found that adolescents in the ostracism condition reported a lower sense of belonging to the group, lower self-esteem, lower sense of meaningful existence, and lower control at posttest as compared to the inclusion group."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"our own results show that, even if ostracized, participants reported a significant decrease in positive mood and their mean score clearly remained on the positive side of the scale (m = 5.53)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"thus, our results give more support to the numbness hypothesis (baumeister et al., 2009) than to the statement that exclusion leads to bad mood (gerber & wheeler, 2009a)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,one may ask whether this procedure produces more extreme feelings of exclusion (because the adolescents are being included first and then being rejected) or fewer extreme feelings of exclusion (because the exclusion episode is shorter).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/Ruggierietal2013SwissJoP.pdf,"in adult samples, partial ostracism as compared to complete ostracism produces smaller effects in need threats and may have produced particularly high reports of perceived control in our study."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,"it is under this meaning that relational devaluation theory incorporates gain-loss theory (aronson & linder, 1965), and suggests that increasingly negative evaluations are more damaging than increasingly positive evaluations (buckley et al., 2004; richardson, green & lago, 1998)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,ostracism is a state in which a relationship has been totally severed because the ostracizer refuses to interact with the ostracized.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,"therefore, increasing the amount of pre-ostracism inclusion should, all other things being equal, heighten the impact of ostracism since there has been a larger amount of relational value to lose."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,"indeed, contrary to a progressive relational devaluation position, it appears that cyberball ostracism was most distressing when it occured from the start before any relationship had been established."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,"one potential problem with the first experiment was that participants may have perceived the game as one long phase of building relational value, instead of two phases, valuation and devaluation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,any differences between these conditions and their equivalent inclusion then ostracism condition would be evidence that participants in ostracism conditions move from a valuation phase to a devaluation phase.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,"furthermore, gain-loss theory would predict that the reversed conditions would be less aversive than their corresponding normal order conditions; the loss of ending in exclusion will be greater than the gain of ending in inclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,this was due largely to an unexpected spreading of the results in the ostracized then included condition.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,"in the ten throw case, being excluded at the start and included for ten throws at the end was highly aversive for some, while for others being included for ten throws at the end was almost like being included for the whole time."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,"thus, relational sequences do impact perceptions of cyberball, and participants do appear to move through valuation and then devaluation phases."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,"the zero throw ostracism condition was again among the most aversive, replicating experiment 1. contrary to progressive relational devaluation, failing to have a relational building phase before ostracism did not reduce its impact, nor did increased time in interaction increase the aversive impact."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,it may be that those ostracized from the beginning were distressed because they did not understand the game but this is unlikely given that participants accurately reported how many throws they received.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,"second, it is plausible that a certain level of relational value is assumed in all new relationships and people in the zero condition felt that the immediate violation was beyond the usual realm of politeness."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,this explanation would be a form of subjective relational devaluation and is explored in experiment 3. experiment 3 the first two studies found that ostracism from the start had the greatest impact on internal needs.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,results from experiment 2 further showed that participants accurately perceived the sequence of throws suggesting that the lessened distress of ostracism after 10 throws of inclusion reflects a genuinely attenuated experience of rejection.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,"the reverse situation, inclusion following a period of ostracism, had differential effects: some participants were as satisfied as if they had been included from the start while others were highly distressed."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,all our results are consistent with the view that experiencing distress following rejection is due to a violation of expectations.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,"it is possible that people have certain minimal expectations for forced interactions with strangers, and that this includes the expectation that people engage in a certain minimal level of interaction before moving on to someone else."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,"for example, if a store clerk did not greet us when we were at the checkout, we might feel slightly rejected because we expected this forced interaction to include some minimal interaction."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,"giving people no inclusion in cyberball violates this basic expectation of cursory politeness, causing the heightened aversive reaction in the zero-throw condition."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,"it may be that, with ten throws of interaction, people feel that they have been interacted with sufficiently and do not feel their expectations have been violated as much by the subsequent exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,"snapp and leary (2001) have similarly found that high levels of familiarity, induced by talking about highly personal topics, can weaken rejection's effects."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,"we, on the other hand, found that expectations do influence the initial reaction to ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,these results do not disprove the primal alarm account of ostracism because expectations did not completely eliminate the impact of ostracism: even those with a high expectation of exclusion still felt greater needs threat than included participants.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/GerberWheelerRelDev2014JOSP.pdf,long-term relationships may be affected by progressive relational devaluation; it is just not a principle applicable to zero acquaintance ostracism.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"he argued that ostracism threatens individuals' fundamental needs for belonging, control over their environments, self-esteem, and a meaningful existence."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,how people respond to an act of ostracism depends on the nuances of the act and which of these needs are threatened the most.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"for instance, some research has shown that people seek out social interaction after being rejected (e.g., maner, dewall, baumeister, & schaller, 2007), whereas other research has found people to behave aggressively toward others (twenge, baumeister, tice, & stucke, 2001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"thus, the nature of the experience of ostracism can provide us clues as to how people will respond to the event."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"in addition, researchers have concluded that, in many cases, ostracism yields unique effects on people that aren't borne out when they experience other negative (interpersonal) episodes."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"the reason being, ignoring or excluding someone can prevent that person from being able to respond to the behavior or redress the situation at hand; it is a generally ineffective strategy to try to communicate with someone who won't listen or pay attention."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"thus, unlike targets of dispute, harassment, or insults, whose retorts and acts of retaliation may more readily be perceived as effective, targets of ostracism are often left feeling powerless, especially after repeated or protracted episodes."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"thus, evidence from a variety of perspectives suggests we should expect the experience of ostracism to be unique compared to the experience of other negative events and interpersonal behaviors."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"in other cases, because of how strongly people tend to react to ostracism (williams, 2007), we might expect the experience, to some extent, to interfere with people's ability to attend to others things (e.g., their work) as they are consumed by and then cope with the experience."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"from a more macro perspective, a recent study by ferris and colleagues (2008), which set out to demonstrate evidence of validity for a workplace ostracism scale, found that self-reports of experiencing ostracism were, in fact, negatively related to supervisor ratings of job performance."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"furthermore, he suggested that after people are ostracized, their basic needs for belonging, self-esteem, control, and meaningfulness are threatened and that during the reflective stage, people behave in ways designed to recoup threatened needs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"along these lines, recent work by beal, weiss, barros, and macdermid (2005) suggested that experiencing an affective event at work (e.g., ostracism) can cause people to allocate cognitive resources away from the task at hand and to the experience itself."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"some research does suggest that people may be so consumed by the experience of ostracism that they allocate resources to recovering, making attributions, or ruminating about the event, thus making it more difficult to attend to other tasks."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"research on motivation from self determination theory (deci & ryan, 2000) has suggested that various needs, including people's needs for relatedness,2 must be fulfilled in order to experience intrinsic motivation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"it follows that to the extent the experience of ostracism at work can lead to decrements in feelings of relatedness, then people's ability to experience their work as intrinsically motivating should be hampered as well."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,the authors argue that being in a positive mood can enhance people's experiences of intrinsic motivation by heightening the level of enjoyment people experience.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"as previously mentioned, williams's (2007) temporal model of ostracism suggests that as the shock of being ostracized wears off, people begin to cope and recover from the experience."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"thus, we expected that ostracized participants initially would perform more poorly relative to participants who were not ostracized, but that over time, as participants recouped from the experience, any performance differences would either no longer persist or be substantially reduced."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"h1b: the experience of ostracism will lead to declines in levels of performance relative to initial measures of performance compared to the experience of inclusion, but such performance differences will be smaller when performance is measured at a later point in time."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"because being in a positive mood has been associated with better performance (beal et al., 2005; erez & isen, 2002), it may be that mood serves as an underlying mechanism for explaining ostracism's effects on performance."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"h2c: the relationship between ostracism and performance will be mediated by positive mood such that ostracism will be negatively related to positive mood, and positive mood, in turn, will be positively related to performance."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"because we were interested in examining decrements in intrinsic motivation, the target activity that participants engaged in after being ostracized or included needed to be something that was moderately interesting in order to avoid witnessing any floor effects in the study."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"if ostracism serves to thwart people's needs for relatedness, and if relatedness is necessary for the experience of intrinsic motivation, we might expect ostracism to have a negative effect on intrinsic motivation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"in particular, we would expect this effect via relatedness: participants who are ostracized should report decrements in relatedness needs which should translate into lower levels of intrinsic motivation for the subsequent task they engage in."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"this activity was selected because it was found to be relatively interesting through pretesting, it could be used to measure performance, and participants could receive online feedback on their performance as they engaged in the task."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"thus, in some condiostracism and performance 289 tions, the computerized players can be programmed to ostracize the participant, whereas in others they can be programmed to include the participant."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"this particular manipulation can systematically induce ostracism (or inclusion) without relying on confederates or actors, and its effects on relatedness and mood have been shown to be relatively strong and comparable to face-to-face ostracism manipulations (williams et al., 2002)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"because this was not the case with positive mood and because prior research on performance and intrinsic motivation has demonstrated relationships with positive mood, we decided to focus only on positive mood in the present research."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"including the pretest control variables could help account for such individual differences, thereby increasing the power of the analyses conducted (see becker, 2005)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"shrout and bolger (2002) argued that the traditional requirement that an independent variable be related to the dependent variable in testing for mediation can be relaxed when effect sizes may be small, which maybe the case here thus we aimed to test whether relatedness could explain a possible indirect effect between ostracism and intrinsic motivation (h3c)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"preacher and hayes (2004, 2008) recommend bootstrapping, particularly with smaller sample sizes, to reduce bias in assessing the significance of the so bel test statistic a distribution of products which includes the so bel test statistic ab tends to be positively skewed and using a normal distribution to assess the significance of the statistic can result in an underpowered test."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"by the time participants reached any of the intrinsic motivation measures, they had already completed a number of tasks and responded to several questionnaires activities that could have served to help participants recoup from the ostracism experience-and showed recovery in positive mood."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"we also controlled for pretest interest in the analyses because, in both conditions, it was significantly related to self-reported intrinsic motivation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"first, across two studies, we found that when we controlled for participants ' initial performance on a word-search task, ostracism had a negative influence on performance."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"thus, it appeared as though the experience of ostracism interfered with participants ' capability to perform on a cognitive task."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"performance among ostracized participants did not appear to improve across time, either-unlike mood, which did appear to improve over time."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"however, the initial decrements in mood that accompanied the experience of ostracism were not found to mediate the performance effect observed."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,the drops in performance we did observe among ostracized participants could be stronger with less interesting tasks; a more interesting task might serve as a more appealing means to recover from the ostracism experience than a boring task would.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"along these lines, research using a different social rejection manipulation found a stronger decline in task performance among rejected participants for a relatively less interesting task (baumeister et al., 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"the findings from the two present studies extend this research by demonstrating for the first time that ostracism can negatively influence performance, though to a lesser extent, even on interesting tasks."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"it could be that for relatedness to influence intrinsic motivation, the target activity itself would have to be social in nature and be the source of the ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,this could explain why the decrements in relatedness caused by experiencing ostracism did not translate into rating a distinct activity as less enjoyable.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,future research should explore whether a task needs to be social in nature for feelings of relatedness to play a role in determining people's intrinsic motivation for a given activity.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,another reason why we may have observed no significant relationships between relatedness and intrinsic motivation could have to do with the nature of the cyberball activity.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,one could argue that it was not such an activity that could allow participants to personally connect with other people and help promote fulfillment of their relatedness needs.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"future research should examine whether facilitating, 300 lustenberger and jagacinski rather than thwarting, the fulfillment of relatedness needs can lead to increases in intrinsic motivation for a task."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"although feelings of relatedness did not appear to play a role in predicting intrinsic motivation, in both studies we did find that ostracism was indirectly related to self-reported intrinsic motivation through positive mood while controlling for initial interest."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"ostracism led to lower levels of positive mood, which itself was associated with greater feelings of intrinsic motivation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"positive mood can arguably be viewed as a more general measure of people's feelings than a measure of fulfillment of relatedness needs, and though the measures were moderately correlated in both studies, positive mood may have served as a better transmitter of the effects of ostracism on intrinsic motivation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,encountering an event that lowers one's level of positive mood could have the effect of reducing one's ability to experience a subsequent task as interesting and enjoyable.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"this may explain why in both studies we witnessed a significant indirect effect of ostracism on intrinsic motivation, controlling for pretest interest, through positive mood, but not through relatedness."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,this raises the possibility that any experience that reduces feelings of positive mood could ultimately inhibit the experience of intrinsic motivation on a subsequent task.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"when participants engaged in the performance trials first, those who were ostracized did not perform as well."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"this decline in performance may have allowed a poorer mood to persist longer than for ostracized participants who engaged in the free-choice trial first instead and who, perhaps, could more freely recover from the ostracism experience."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"although this study has demonstrated what can happen when people are ostracized, it is unclear whether we can expect similar effects among employees working in organizations."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"however, it is quite possible that effects would be stronger and more persistent in the field where individuals who are ostracized may experience exclusion on a daily basis."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,williams (2007) argued that repeated or drawn-out acts of ostracism can have profound effects on mental health and functioning.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"in sum, the results suggest that ostracism can have important effects on performance, feelings of relatedness, positive mood, and indirectly on intrinsic motivation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf57.pdf,"the relationship between ostracism and performance can even be considered in light of individuals intentionally, passively aggressively ostracizing others with the intent to impede their progress on work tasks (e.g., failing to pass along vital information)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,those with low anxious attachment and high baseline pain thresholds reported lower post manipulation pain thresholds in the exclusion conditions than in the control conditions.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"conclusions: across studies, results suggested that post manipulation pain threshold reports of individuals with high baseline pain thresholds were particularly responsive to social exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,the form of the response was dependent on the level of anxious attachment.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,the present studies provide evidence that variance in pain threshold reports not accounted for by pain intensity may reflect the use of pain reports to satisfy social needs.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"this work also suggests that baseline measures of pain thresholds may, in interaction with psychological variables, have predictive power beyond serving as a control variable."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,pain tolerance is measured by asking participants to stop a painful stimulus when the pain is no longer bearable.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"chapman et al (1), in a review of pain assessment techniques, argued that pain threshold measures produce relatively inconsistent results and are subject to influence from placebo effects, expectancy, instructional set and other psychological factors."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"therefore, one basis for examining the meaning of pain threshold reports may be tracking discrepancies between pain tolerance (as a marker of pain intensity) and pain threshold."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,conditions that influence pain tolerance and pain threshold differently (8-14) may provide insight into factors other than pain intensity that drive pain threshold reports.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,one potentially important factor in examining the meaning of pain threshold reports is that such reports may be uniquely vulnerable to subjective distortion.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,pain tolerance measures should be less subject to distortion than self-reports of pain threshold because of the extent to which they rely on nonverbal expression of pain (15).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"thus, shifts in pain threshold not accompanied by similar shifts in pain tolerance (or vice-versa) may indicate an influence on pain sensitivity reports other than pain intensity."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"similarly, the variance remaining in pain threshold reports after controlling for pain tolerance scores may reflect, at least in part, subjective distortion in reports of pain sensitivity."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"in this interpersonal context, pain reports may take on a social communication function."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"some participants may believe that a pain task allows them to communicate interpersonal qualities such as stoicism, toughness or vulnerability (2)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"taken together, this analysis suggests that those who report high pain thresholds (especially while controlling for pain tolerance) may be individuals who subjectively distort pain reports because they believe such reports convey important social meaning."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"as a result, postbaseline pain threshold reports may be distorted to satisfy salient social concerns, such as belongingness needs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,previous research examining the predictive power of baseline pain thresholds in the context of reminders of mortality supports the notion that those who report high pain thresholds at baseline use subsequent pain threshold reports to satisfy psychological needs.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,reminders of mortality have been shown to motivate individuals to strive for self-esteem and validation of their personal worldviews as compensation for anxiety about death (18).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"one interpretation of these data is that individuals who attached personal meaning to pain reports at baseline (ie, those with high baseline pain thresholds) and who had been reminded of death were particularly motivated to appear to be without pain in the post manipulation pain task."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,demonstration of imperviousness to pain may have provided relief from death anxiety by providing a sense of invulnerability to physical threats (potentially a means for feeling less vulnerable to death in the short term and/or an important aspect of the worldview of those who value low pain sensitivity).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"importantly, no effects across experimental conditions were evident for post manipulation pain tolerance, suggesting that the manipulation influenced subjective reports rather than degree of pain intensity."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"overall, these data suggested that pain thresholds were manipulated to satisfy psychological needs arising from reminders of mortality."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,the present research more specifically examines the hypothesis that pain threshold reports can be used to satisfy the psychological need for belongingness.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"if pain threshold reports are seen by those with high baseline pain thresholds as serving a social communication function, then conditions that heighten belongingness needs should lead to predictable changes in subsequent pain threshold reports."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,one experience that has been shown to increase the need felt for belongingness is social exclusion.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,individuals randomly assigned to experience or recall social exclusion have been shown to demonstrate increased motivation for interpersonal connection (19) and heightened attention to social information (20).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"how an individual responds to the desire for connection, when spurred by exclusion, is influenced by the individual's level of interpersonal security in a fashion that is particularly relevant in the context of pain research."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"expressions of emotional distress, including reports of pain, provide a signal of vulnerability that can motivate caregiving responses by others (21)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"although useful for recruiting social support, such expressions of vulnerability also entail a degree of social risk."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"expressions of emotional distress can be met by negative forms of support, such as interpersonal rejection, that exacerbate rather than reduce the distress (21)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"as a result, individuals withhold signals of vulnerability unless they are reasonably confident their distress will be met with support (22)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"the perceived consequences of turning to others for social support, therefore, may influence the expression of pain."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,those high on the dimension of anxious attachment tend to be concerned about the possibility of further social harm resulting from calls for support because they tend to doubt their acceptability to others.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"as a result, anxiously attached individuals are hypervigilant for signs of rejection."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"although these individuals strongly desire support and validation from others, they also fear that pursuing support will lead to rejection."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,those high on the dimension of avoidant attachment doubt the availability of support because they view others as unreliable.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,avoidantly attached individuals tend to be uncomfortable turning to others for support because they do not expect such calls for support to be helpful in relieving distress.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"those who are less secure in the availability of quality support respond in a more defensive fashion, withholding expressions of vulnerability to reduce the risk of further social harm or disappointing support provision."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"first, those who report higher pain thresholds at baseline (ie, before exclusion) should be more likely to view subsequent pain reports as having a socially expressive function."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"thus, when belongingness needs are heightened by social exclusion, those with high baseline pain thresholds should seek to resolve their social needs through subsequent pain threshold performance, more so than those with low baseline pain thresholds."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"second, the performance of those with high baseline pain thresholds should depend on their level of attachment security."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,those with low levels of security should be hesitant to reveal vulnerability and should thus report relatively high post manipulation pain thresholds.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,such a display of invulnerability should help ease concerns about rejection for insecure individuals.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"those with high levels of security should be comfortable with vulnerability following exclusion and, thus, should report relatively low pain thresholds."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,low pain threshold reports may be used by secure individuals as a means of recruiting care and concern.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"a main effect of anxious attachment was also found, such that higher anxious attachment was related to a more negative mood, β=-0.330, p=0.009, r2=0.083."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,discussion the results of study 1 suggested that individuals who reported higher pain thresholds in the baseline pain task were more likely to adjust their subsequent pain threshold reports across experimental conditions than those who reported low baseline pain thresholds.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"these results were found while controlling for both baseline and post manipulation pain tolerance, suggesting that the effects are more attributable to displays of pain than variation in experienced pain intensity."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,these data are consistent with the hypothesis that those with high baseline pain thresholds use pain threshold reports to regulate social needs.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"the reaction of those with high baseline pain thresholds to social exclusion appeared to depend on levels of anxious, but not avoidant, attachment (see general discussion for consideration of this point)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,those with high baseline pain thresholds and low anxious attachment reported significantly lower post manipulation pain thresholds in the exclusion condition than in the inclusion condition.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,these participants appeared to respond to exclusion with a display of vulnerability to pain.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"conversely, although the trend did not reach significance, those with high baseline pain thresholds and high anxious attachment reported somewhat higher post manipulation pain thresholds in the exclusion condition than in the inclusion condition."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"this is consistent with a show of invulnerability to pain, although the weakness of the effect renders its reliability questionable."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"the exclusion manipulation did not influence participants' reports of discomfort or pain tolerance, suggesting the relatively manipulable nature of pain threshold reports are especially targeted as a means of regulating social needs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"furthermore, baseline pain threshold was unrelated to mood, either alone or in interaction with other variables, suggesting that mood cannot account for these effects."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"study 1, then, provides some support for the argument that pain threshold reports can be used to satisfy social concerns."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"although statistical support was weak in the case of those with high anxious attachment, this may be a function of the nature of the control condition."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"anxiously attached individuals, who are hypervigilant for cues of rejection, may have subjectively experienced noninclusion even when receiving their fair share of throws (ie, 10 or one-quarter of the throws)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"that is, watching 30 of 40 throws go to other participants may have led to some feelings of exclusion (note that the manipulation check asked about the degree of inclusion by other players rather than subjective feelings of inclusion)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"it is possible, then, that anxiously attached individuals in the present study experienced heightened belongingness needs in both the inclusion and exclusion conditions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"incorporating a different manipulation allowed not only increased precision, but the opportunity to examine general iz ability across different op e rationalizations of social exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"as with the trend in study 1, those with high baseline pain thresholds and high anxious attachment reported particularly high post manipulation pain thresholds in the exclusion condition, relative to the control condition."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,that this effect is significant when using a more asocial control condition in study 2 suggests that the small effect in study 1 may be a result of the control condition raising belongingness concerns for anxiously attached individuals.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"thus, this result may best be framed as suggesting that those with high baseline pain thresholds and high anxious attachment may not, under normal conditions, be motivated to maintain the appearance of pain insensitivity across trials."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"it may also be possible that these individuals, as they become more comfortable with the experimental setting, become increasingly motivated to report low pain thresholds to recruit sympathy."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"second, those with low baseline pain thresholds and high anxious attachment reported significantly lower pain thresholds in the exclusion condition than in the control condition in study 2 only."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,this finding may reflect some degree of vulnerability display following social exclusion.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"because these two effects differed from study 1, replication in a third study was needed for confidence in their reliability."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"this again suggests that the manipulation affected participants' motivation to regulate their appearance of sensitivity to pain, but did not affect their ability to withstand the painful stimulus."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,one potential criticism of the results of study 2 is that the difference across conditions for those with high baseline pain thresholds and high anxious attachment may be due to the effect of the control rather than the exclusion condition.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"thus, there may be something about thinking about television viewing that causes this effect, rather than something about considering a past rejection."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,it is possible that there is some feature of the cold pressor task that may be necessary for exclusion to affect pain threshold.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"second, the measure of discomfort was eliminated to reduce any cognitive load that may have distracted participants and caused them to forget the task instructions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,this question was meant to focus participants on a stressful topic to create some equivalence with the stress that may arise from writing about rejection.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,the pattern of the data suggests that anxiously attached individuals with high baseline pain thresholds responded to a reminder of exclusion by appearing insensitive to pain.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"the present study also suggests that the effect cannot be attributed to some peculiarity of the television control condition used in study 2, because control participants were asked to write about a different topic in the current study - a stressful examination experience."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"as in study 2, individuals with high baseline pain thresholds and high anxious attachment who were randomly assigned to the control condition appeared to report particularly low post manipulation pain thresholds."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"that this pattern was found using two distinctly different control conditions suggests that those with high baseline pain thresholds and high anxious attachment may normally shift from a low vulnerability display to a high vulnerability display as time passes, without the presence of social exclusion reminders."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"as noted previously, this may reflect a change from the salience of rejection concerns to the salience of desire for support."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"however, those reminded of exclusion may have kept their original rejection concerns salient and reported higher post manipulation pain thresholds in a display of invulnerability"
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"given that the manipulation again had no effect on pain tolerance, the effect of exclusion seems to be on the appearance of insensitivity to pain, rather than on a change in experienced pain intensity."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,study 3 also showed that individuals with high baseline pain thresholds and low anxious attachment reported significantly lower post manipulation pain thresholds in the exclusion condition than in the control condition.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"a significant effect was also found for those with low baseline pain thresholds and low anxious attachment, such that higher pain thresholds were reported in the exclusion condition than in the control condition."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"in all three studies, random assignment to social exclusion experiences led to changes in reports of pain threshold, but not of pain tolerance."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"thus, some of the variance in pain threshold measures not accounted for by pain intensity may result from the distortion of pain threshold reports to compensate for psychological threats."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"across three studies, those with high baseline pain thresholds and high anxious attachment reported particularly high post manipulation pain thresholds following social exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"anxiously attached individuals are chronically hypervigilant for rejection, but crave support (24)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"in this light, the high pain thresholds reported only in the social exclusion conditions appear to represent a protective display of low vulnerability in response to the salience of rejection fears."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"in two of three studies, those with high baseline pain thresholds and low anxious attachment reported lower pain thresholds following social exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,such admission of vulnerability is consistent with the mindset of those who expect supportive responses to signs of distress.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"that these effects across condition were evident for the reporting of pain threshold, but not pain tolerance, suggests that those with high baseline pain thresholds subjectively altered their pain threshold reports to satisfy relational needs that were heightened by the social exclusion experience."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"understanding the role of pain threshold reports in the satisfaction of psychological needs, such as belongingness, may help clarify some unsettled questions in the pain literature."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"evidence suggests that these pain threshold reports cannot be accounted for by the effects of malnutrition (32), peripheral neuropathy (33), or physiological markers such as heart rate and blood pressure (31), and are not affected by the administration of opiate antagonists (34)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"because high pain threshold reports continue following recovery from bulimia nervosa (35), factors related to the satisfaction of stable psychological needs may be responsible."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"the high pain threshold reports of those with eating disorders, therefore, may reflect distorted reports that serve to satisfy interpersonal insecurities - by displaying low vulnerability - and needs for an image of high self-control by exhibiting the ability to withstand physical pain."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"similarly, although depressed individuals experience higher levels of clinical pain, a meta-analysis of experimental research shows that depression is associated with higher experimental pain thresholds (37)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"given the strong link between depression and higher levels of anxious attachment (38), the high pain threshold reports of depressed individuals may represent a display of invulnerability in what may be seen as a nonsupportive and threatening interpersonal context."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"although no specific predictions were made in the current studies about what form of attachment insecurity may influence pain reports, the present results suggest that anxious attachment plays a more important role than avoidant attachment in influencing reports of pain threshold."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"in general, avoidantly attached individuals are not emotionally expressive, do not see relationships as a means for regulating distress and do not easily trust others (27)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"perhaps, then, these individuals were seemingly unresponsive to the different social circumstances across experimental conditions because expressions of vulnerability to a stranger are not seen by them as relevant to the regulation of pain-related distress."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"avoidantly attached individuals may, instead, regulate such distress intrapersonally (eg, by cognitively suppressing it; 24), in a manner that is not affected by the social environment."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,dewall and baumeister (39) showed that individuals randomly assigned to receive feedback suggesting that their lives would be plagued by loneliness demonstrated higher pain thresholds and tolerance relative to those in control conditions.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,the demonstration of the effect on pain tolerance suggests that this feedback led to a decrease in experienced pain intensity and not just distorted self-reports.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"in fact, a number of social animals have been shown to respond to social isolation with decreased pain sensitivity (40)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"however, the present research appears to demonstrate that not all forms of social exclusion lead to such analgesic responses."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"those in dewall and baumeister's research (39) were told their loneliness would be life-long and inevitable, whereas participants in the current research experienced more transient forms of exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"more generally, pain researchers should be aware of the growing body of work suggesting that the emotional experience of hurt feelings activates aspects of physical pain affect systems (41)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"perhaps most importantly, there is no direct evidence that suggests why those with higher baseline pain thresholds appeared more reactive to the social exclusion manipulation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"indeed, these beliefs may not be held consciously and/or may not be formed until participants engage in baseline pain sensitivity tasks."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,past research has provided some suggestion that conscious beliefs about pain are not predictive of performance on experimental pain tasks.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"however, construction of more reliable, multi-item pain belief measures for future research may provide a better window into the motivations of those with high baseline pain thresholds."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"in addition, the one-trial method of pain measurement (ie, completion of the cold pressor or finger pressure task only once to measure pain threshold and tolerance) used in the present research may limit its reliability and may account for some of the variability across studies."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"thus, more reliable measurement techniques support the conclusion that those with high baseline pain thresholds appear to respond to psychological threats through adjustments of subsequent pain threshold reports."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,supplementary analyses (available on request) revealed that controlling for sex did not influence the pattern of results.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"in the work on mortality salience, macdonald (unpublished data) similarly found that controlling for the variance accounted for by gender did not change the influence of baseline pain threshold on subsequent pain sensitivity measures, nor did gender significantly interact with baseline pain threshold (although the interaction analyses were similarly underpowered)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,it is possible that the experience of pain measurement may have contaminated responses to the attachment questionnaires.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"furthermore, attachment theory suggests that individuals' attachment models are activated by the experience of distress (24)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"thus, it is arguable that measuring the attachment dimensions following a pain experience may provide a more accurate means of assessing the attachment concerns that arise in the context of acute or chronic pain than those taken before pain trials."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"overall, the present research suggests that some of the reliable, unique variance in pain threshold measures not associated with experienced pain intensity may represent the use of pain reports for the satisfaction of psychological needs, including belongingness."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,past research has shown that participants are less likely to report embarrassing behaviour (as some may perceive the admission of pain) even when a researcher has only potential access to their responses (42).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"thus, researchers who wish to control for social influences in experimental pain research may need to devise methods to ensure high degrees of privacy and anonymity for participants."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"however, real-life pain is itself a social experience, and the current research provides some insight into factors that may shape the communication of painful states."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf58.pdf,"whereas experienced pain intensity may be an important aspect of maintaining physical integrity, the communication of pain appears important for at least some individuals' psychological integrity."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"girls who were ostensibly ignored during the game demonstrated poorer cognitive performance than those who were included by their coplayers, while boys did not."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"in the adult literature, there is growing evidence that social exclusion-or ostracism-may be a particularly noxious aspect of correspondence should be addressed to david hawes, school of psychology, the university of sydney, sydney, nsw 2006, australia."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"in childhood, ostracism has been conceptualized as a non confrontational form of behavioural rejection that communicates peer dislike for a child, and restricts access to the social and instrumental resources that may be found in peer activities (e.g., buhs, ladd, & herald, 2006; gazzelle & druhen, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"exposure to peer rejection and victimization in childhood has been associated with poor academic performance (e.g., wentzel & caldwell, 1997), withdrawal from classroom participation (e.g., buhs et al., 2006; parker, & asher, 1987) and aggression (e.g., mcdougall, hymel, vaillancourt, & mercer, 2001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"importantly, however, the consequences of peer exclusion on children's developmental trajectories appear to be distinct from those associated with other forms of peer victimization."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"found that different forms of classroom disengagement evolve from chronic peer exclusion versus chronic peer abuse (i.e., physical and verbal aggression)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"whereas chronically abused children were more likely than their peers to avoid the school context, chronically excluded children were more likely to become disengaged from classroom activities."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"furthermore, it was found that chronic peer exclusion strongly mediated the association between peer group rejection in kindergarten and children's poor achievement during the middle-school years."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,it has been proposed that chronic exposure to peer exclusion may impact adversely on children's social and academic functioning through a number of processes.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"in addition to limiting children's access to, and participation in, classroom activities, chronic peer exclusion may function as a persistent signal to classmates that particular children are not integral members of the classroom peer group."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"this may in turn further restrict interactions with peers in contexts outside of the classroom (buhs et al., 2006; coie, 1990)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"excluded children may then respond by devaluing their relationships with peer group members and escalating their attempts to withdraw from classroom activities and interactions in which exclusion occurs (baumeister & leary, 1995; leary, 2001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"however while it seems likely that ostracism may disrupt academic achievement through processes such as these, there is emerging evidence to suggest that ostracism may also impact more directly on the cognitive processes on which academic achievement relies."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"while performance on tasks requiring effortful control (e.g., logical reasoning or extrapolation from memorized information) were significantly disrupted by the threat of social exclusion, performance on tasks involving direct retrieval of information (e.g., free recall of word stimuli) was not affected."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"while social exclusion has been shown to elicit emotional arousal in both adults and children (e.g., abrams, weick, thomas, colbe, & franklin, 2011; williams, cheung, & choi, 2000), such arousal was not found to account for the effects of exclusion on cognitive processes reported by baumeister et al."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"it was speculated, rather, that individuals may respond to the aversive impact of social exclusion by allocating self-regulatory resources to the management of this impact."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"experimental research has also shown that in both adults and children, the aversive experience of ostracism threatens four key domains conceptualized by williams (2007) as ''primary human needs ' ' belonging ness control, self-esteem, and meaningful existence (abrams et al., 2011; williams et al., 2000)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,belongingness refers to the need to feel wanted and included by others.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"the need for a meaningful existence is essentially the need for a sense that ''i exist and i matter'', with ostracized individuals often reporting a feeling of invisibility (williams, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"self-esteem-a feeling of positivity toward oneself-has been conceptualized in the ostracism literature as a gauge of relational valuation that, when low, signals to the individual that changes must be made to improve inclusionary status."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"finally, the need for control refers to the need to feel that one has an impact on others or a group (williams, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,proposed that efforts to suppress distress following experiences of exclusion may in turn monopolize some of the executive functions necessary for effortful cognitive operations.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"there is also evidence that the relation between friendship features and social exclusion differs for boys and girls depending on the social context (underwood & buhrmester, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"if the impact of ostracism on cognitive processes previously observed in adulthood begins in childhood, it may function to amplify the social and academic difficulties experienced by excluded children, and account in part for the poor achievement outcomes associated with exclusion (e.g., buhs et al., 2006)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"showed that in children aged 8-14 years, ostracism induced by cyberball threatened the same primary needs as in adults, while masten et al."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,found that patterns of neural activation shown by adolescents in response to cyberball are consistent with those associated with ostracism in adults.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"there is also evidence that working memory deficits are related to social problems in children (e.g., alloway et al., 2005), and problems in dynamic social decoding-the ability to rapidly interpret nonverbal social and emotional cues in others (phillips, tunstall, & channon, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"in line with the adult data, we also predicted that these effects would be most pronounced on cognitive tasks that place demands on executive functions (backward digit recall/span), and that basic ones involving only simple recall (forward digit recall/span) would remain largely unaffected."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"based on existing evidence that girls are more likely to experience exclusionary gestures than boys (underwood et al., 2004), it was further predicted that the effects of ostracism on cognitive performance would be more prominent among girls than boys."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"while ostracism in the real world can often occur in circumstances beyond the game-playing scenario represented in cyberball (e.g., not being invited to a birthday party), there is evidence that individuals' experiences of ostracism in this paradigm do relate to realworld social experiences."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"our pilot testing indicated that children became too restless distracted to engage in the 40 ball-tosses typically administered with adults; the optimal number of tosses for children was found to be 20, which was ultimately adopted for the current study."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"as such, while boys and girls differed on this subtest more in the exclusion condition than in the inclusion condition, scores within each gender group did not differ significantly as a function of ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,we found that ostracized children reported a greater threat to primary needs than their included peers.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,s (2011) finding that the experience of ostracism in cyberball evokes negative mood states in children.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"while it remains unclear precisely how the effects of ostracism may change across development, it has been proposed that humans are hardwired to respond to ostracism in this way (e.g., williams & zadro, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"in adults, the experience of ostracism has been shown to not only adversely affect mood and threaten primary needs, but also to disrupt cognitive processes (baumeister et al., 2002)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"girls who were ostracized in cyberball demonstrated poorer cognitive performance immediately following this experience than those who were included by their co-players, while boys did not."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"there may be various explanations as to why, in contrast to previous adult data, cognitive processes under effortful control were not found to be disrupted by ostracism in our sample."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"due to the limitations of the study, it is premature to interpret these divergent findings as reflecting developmental differences in the effects of ostracism on adults versus children."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,it is possible the disruptions to cognitive processes produced by cyberball were less enduring than those produced by baumeister et al.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,it is therefore possible that the executive functions previously found to be disrupted by ostracism in adults may include those not specifically indexed in the current cognitive test battery.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"likewise, given that cyberball operationalizes ostracism in terms of only one type of social context, it is also possible that ostracism in other contexts may produce somewhat different effects on child cognition."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,our finding that ostracism disrupted girls' cognitive performance presents implications for conceptualizing the mechanisms through which peer exclusion confers risk for poor child outcomes throughout the school-age years.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"previous research has found that children subject to frequent exclusion by peers are at risk of becoming disengaged from classroom activities, and exhibit poor academic achievement in later years (buhs et al., 2006)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"this risk is not surprising given that peer ostracism in the school context would, by definition, be expected to directly prevent children from fully participating in classroom learning activities."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"however, our data suggest that interactions involving ostracism in the classroom may also compromise some children's capacity to absorb the educational material presented in class."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"not only do girls rely more on relational aggression than boys to express anger and dislike for peers, but there is also evidence to suggest that girls are more likely to engage in rumination strategies following negative events particularly those involving social exclusion (paquette & underwood, 1999)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"it is also interesting to note that despite the gender-specific effect of ostracism on cognitive performance, both boys and girls appeared to be equally threatened by the experience of ostracism in cyberball."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"williams and sommer (1997), for example, found that while the effects of ostracism on primary needs was not moderated by gender, men and women demonstrated distinct behavioural responses following experimentally induced ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"they found that women were more likely to socially compensate (i.e., work harder on collective tasks), whereas men were more likely to engage in social loafing (williams & sommer, 1997)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"such evidence suggests that while the girls in our study were just as threatened as the boys by ostracism, the way in which they responded to this threat involved somewhat distinct (cognitive) processes."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"it is possible, for example, that a larger sample may have provided the power to detect additional gender interactions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,we did not find that the disruption to cognitive performance following ostracism was related to participant mood.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,it is not known whether the individual differences that have been found to moderate the effects of ostracism on other domains may also moderate the effects of ostracism on cognitive processes.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"similarly, youth characterized by high levels of interpersonal competence (i.e., adaptive social skills) have been found to display greater neural evidence of regulation while being subjected to ostracism in cyberball (masten et al., 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,the examination of such individual differences in future research may therefore contribute valuable evidence regarding the mechanisms through which ostracism operates on cognitive performance.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf39.pdf,"another question arising from the current data is whether the effects of ostracism on cognitive performance interact with the developmental changes in working memory that have been identified across middlechildhood and adolescence (see bunge & wright, 2007)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf64.pdf,understanding variables that influence the intensity of negative affective responses to ostracism is important for predicting emotional consequences of ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf64.pdf,"subjective emotional responses associated with approach vs withdrawal motivation are influenced by asymmetric frontal cortical activity (harmon-jones, 2003; schutter et al., 2008; carver and harmon-jones, 2009)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf64.pdf,"based on past research, we would predict that anger should be associated with greater relative left frontal activation, whereas sadness should be associated with greater relative right frontal activation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf64.pdf,this prediction would lead us to expect ostracism to not evoke greater relative left or greater relative right frontal cortical activity (i.e.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf64.pdf,the results of study 1 suggest that reflexive emotional responses to ostracism involve anger and the degree of anger depends critically on the degree of relative left cortical activation aroused by ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf64.pdf,"also, results suggest that both condition and relative left frontal cortical activation play a role in perceived control, so that during ostracism increased left frontal activation was associated with decreased control, whereas during inclusion the opposite effect was found."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf64.pdf,"furthermore, it is possible that the predicted interaction involving sadness was not found in study 1 due to the small effect of ostracism on sadness and to restricted range of frontal asymmetry scores."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf64.pdf,perhaps the direct manipulation of frontal asymmetry will create greater variance in the asymmetric frontal activity and allow the predicted effect to emerge.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf64.pdf,"because of this loss of participants and because the procedure of study 2 involved deception, we conducted another experiment (without eeg) using the procedure of study 1 to assess whether the hand contraction manipulation affected self-reported anger."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"research states that peerrejected youngsters form a vulnerable group for negative developmental outcomes, including aggression, antisocial behavior, and adjustment problems (coie, dodge, & kupersmidt, 1990; juvonen, graham, & schuster, 2003), and are more likely to drop out from school (buhs & ladd, 2001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"while peer rejection is hurtful at any point in life, especially during adolescence peer rejection is extremely painful (davey, yu¨cel, & allen, 2008; prinstein & aikins, 2004)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"the development in social cognition makes adolescents highly aware of their social situation (sebastian, viding, williams, & blakemore, 2010) and of the consequences and social costs of failing in these situations (davey et al., 2008)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"because specific brain areas related to acquiring cognitive skills that are needed for emotion regulation are still developing during adolescence (casey, jones, & hare, 2008; steinberg, 2005), adolescents find it difficult to deal effectively with intensely felt emotions (garnefski, kraaij, & spinhoven, 2001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"the brains of older individuals, for example young adults, are further developed, which increases the ability to successfully regulate emotions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"therefore, young adults will be better able to deal with, for example, rejection-based emotions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"in brief, both adolescents and young adults will be influenced by peer rejection; however, adolescents lack the skills to effectively regulate the associated emotions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"therefore, it is expected that specifically the combination of being adolescent and being rejected by peers will lead to an internal state of emotional reactivity that will affect the adolescent's cognitions in terms of moral judgment."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,rejection-based anger and moral judgment of media content (step 2) the gam proposes that the input variables lead to a certain internal state that influences behavioral outcomes; in our case this behavior refers to a preference for antisocial media content.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"as peer rejection will lead to intense feelings of anger and frustration in adolescents, the question is how this may affect their behavior in terms of media preferences."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,one way in which emotions may affect media preferences is in the emotion regulation beliefs of adolescents.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"youngsters seem to believe that using antisocial media (e.g., violent video games and loud music) helps them in dealing with feelings of anger and frustration (arnett, 1991; olson, 2010; olson, kutner, & warner, 2008)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"therefore, rejection-based feelings of anger and frustration may make adolescents prone to a preference for antisocial media content, as a means of emotion regulation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"however, research on these beliefs has shown that the use of violent media in response to feelings of anger is not an effective way of dealing with these emotions and may even lead to increased aggression (bushman, 2002; bushman, baumeister, & phillips, 2001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,another route through which rejection related feelings of anger and frustration in adolescents may affect their media preferences is via cognitions like moral judgment.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"following the gam, the mutual influence of emotions and cognitions determines the behavior in which the cognitive route plays a key role (e.g., schemata and knowledge structures; anderson & bushman, 2001, p. 356)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,research shows that negative moods can be linked to self-focused moral judgments and behavior.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"for example, anger triggered in one situation automatically elicits blame cognitions in other situations (quigley & tedeschi, 1996)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"likewise, people primed with anger increased their punitive attribution and judgment of characters in fictional tort cases (lerner, goldberg, & tetlock, 1998)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"moreover, a recent study showed that anger influenced judgments of moral permissibility (ugazio, lamm, & singer, 2012)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"plaisier and konijn change in moral judgment induced by feelings of anger could be further explained by overarousal: people in negative moods focus on their own needs instead of the needs of others, which inhibits their prosocial moral judgments (eisenberg, 2000; eisenberg et al., 1994)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,the anger and frustration resulting from being rejected will therefore narrow the adolescent's moral judgment to self-interest and hinder prosocial moral judgment.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"therefore, we assume that the preference for antisocial media content in peer-rejected adolescents will finally be mediated by their cognitive moral judgment of the media content."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"when people judge the behavior in the media as tolerable, this would in general instigate a stronger preference for the media content than when someone judges the media content as immoral or intolerable (zillmann, 2000)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"we argued that within the present state induced by the combined influence of adolescence and peer rejection, intense feelings of anger and frustration impair adolescents' moral judgment of antisocial media content, subsequently leading to a preference for this type of media content."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"in addition, adolescents scoring higher on trait empathy showed a lower preference for antisocial media content (r -.38, p .01) and judged these types of media content as less tolerable (r -.35, p .01)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"this finding is in accordance with what would be expected from the literature on gender differences in media use (hoffner & levine, 2005) and thereby contributes to the validity of our measurement of moral judgment and media preferences."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"because this procedure uses fewer parameter estimates, power remains high, reducing possible type ii errors (preacher & hayes, 2004)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"also, resampling the data overcomes the problem of nonnormal distribution, yielding more accurate parameter estimates, which further reduces possible type i errors (preacher & hayes, 2008)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"when zero is not between the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval, it can be claimed with 95% confidence that the assumed indirect effect is not zero, indicating a significant indirect effect."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"a clear direct effect of anger on moral judgment of antisocial media content was also found (a3: b .27, p .01); adolescents with higher levels of rejection-based anger had more tolerable moral judgments of antisocial media content."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"however, results did show a direct effect between moral judgment and their preferences for antisocial media content, with young adults reporting a higher tolerance having a stronger preference for antisocial media content (b2: b .58, p .01)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"thus, for young adults, being rejected by peers did not lead to stronger preferences for antisocial media content."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"peer rejection and preferences for neutral/social media content for reasons of comparison, the effects of peer rejection on preferences for neutral/social media content were also tested because we predicted that the effect of adolescents being rejected by peers would primarily affect preferences for media portraying antisocial behavior."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"yet, adolescents' moral judgment of neutral/social media content had a direct effect on the preference for this type of media (b2: b .43, p .01)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"furthermore, results did show a significant effect of peer rejection on moral judgment of neutral/social media content (a2: b .27, p .05), with peerrejected young adults rating neutral/social media content as more tolerable than accepted young adults."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"moral judgment significantly influenced the preference for neutral/social media content (b2: b .47, p .01) such that participants with a more tolerable moral judgment toward the neutral/social media content showed stronger preferences for this type of media."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"building on and further specifying the general aggression model (gam; anderson & bushman, 2001), we argued that adolescents' preferences for media portraying antisocial, immoral, and risky media content can be explained from being rejected by peers, which is key during adolescence."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"the underlying mechanisms in between being rejected by peers and such media preferences were assumed to be (a) rejection-based anger and frustration, which induced (b) a more lenient moral judgment toward antisocial behaviors in the media."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"peer-rejected adolescents reported higher levels of anger and frustration, which were related to a more lenient moral judgment of antisocial, risky, and immoral media content."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,the present findings are in line with developmental literature showing that peer rejection has a large impact on adolescents.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"due to the underdevelopment of sufficient and appropriate emotion regulation strategies, adolescents lack the skills to effectively deal with the intense negative emotions induced by peer rejection (casey et al., 2008; garnefski et al., 2001; steinberg, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"young adults, on the other hand, generally have more developed emotion regulation skills and will therefore deal more effectively with rejection-based emotions (garnefski & kraaij, 2006; steinberg, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"this may explain why for adolescents peer rejection leads to a preference for antisocial media content, while for young adults this relation could not be established."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"likewise, due to the underdevelopment of emotion regulation strategies, adolescents may believe that using media containing high levels of antisocial behavior will help them in dealing with rejection-based feelings of anger and frustration."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"thus far, only a few studies have tested such cathartic effects of media use, showing that individuals who use violent media content in the belief that this would help them to cope with anger were even more aggressive afterward (bushman, 2002; bushman et al., 2001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"thus, referring to antisocial media content to regulate rejectionbased anger and frustration seems an ineffective emotion regulation strategy."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"while we did not measure the effects of media exposure as such, it is likely that the peer-rejected youngsters who showed a stronger preference for antisocial, risky, and immoral media content will in turn be more susceptible to negative media effects."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"this is in accordance with the assumed long-term repeated exposure to violent media effects in the gam (anderson & bushman, 2002) as well as with a reinforcing downward spiral model in which media selection and effects mutually reinforce each other (slater, henry, swaim, & anderson, 2003)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"that is, antisocial media selection in adolescence as a response to peer rejection will influence beliefs, attitudes, and behavior accordingly, leading to even stronger preferences for antisocial media content, which would result in a downward spiral of ongoing negative influences (slater, 2004, 2007; slater et al., 2003)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"furthermore, as predicted by the gam, exposure to antisocial media content may produce aggression related knowledge structures and a hostile expectation bias (bushman & anderson, 2002)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"in this way, developmental outcomes of media influences and peer rejection maybe intertwined and enforce a downward spiral."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"however, the experimental setting may also be seen as a limitation, and our procedure might not be considered representative for peer rejection in daily life."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,it can be argued that peer rejection on a daily basis probably is even more hurtful.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"thus, in real life, this may perhaps lead to even stronger effects."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"moreover, we cannot draw any conclusions with regard to possible long-term effects in line with the gam's claims that repeated exposure to antisocial media content will lead to hostile knowledge structures."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"at best, we may suggest that stronger preferences for antisocial media content will instigate larger amounts of exposure to such content, which may lead to detrimental effects on adolescent development."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"however, as we tested various models, we may suggest a causal path because only the model with a double mediation in between peer rejection and antisocial media preferences was significant."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"in our study, peer rejection did not have a direct effect on antisocial media preferences, whereas the analyses suggest that peer rejection indirectly influences antisocial media preferences via anger and a more tolerable moral judgment."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"thus, the results indicate that rejection-based anger and moral judgment are underlying mechanisms explaining preferences for antisocial media content in adolescents."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"given the design of the current study, feelings of anger and frustration were directly related to being rejected by peers."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"nevertheless, we cannot know from the present results whether feelings of anger evoked by other sources, or other emotions such as anxiety, may affect moral judgment and media preferences in a similar way."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"in all, our results supported a process model in which peer rejection in adolescence evokes intense feelings of anger and frustration, which instigates a tolerable moral judgment of antisocial, immoral, and risky behavior as portrayed in the media."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"subsequently, a more tolerable moral judgment was closely tied to a preference for antisocial media content."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,this underpins our suggestion that especially peer-rejected adolescents might be at risk for negative media effects.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,they may benefit from our results by further studying and stimulating the development of appropriate emotion regulation strategies and thereby limiting proposed heightened exposure to antisocial media content.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"conclusions our study shows, for the first time, how peer rejection may lead to a preference for antisocial media content."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf66.pdf,"therefore, peer-rejected youngsters seem more at risk for undesired media influences than their accepted counterparts."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf44.pdf,"recent social psychological investigations seem to support this learning process: the experience of subtle manipulations of physical warmth (as compared to coldness) leads to the perception of another as more sociable (central to the person characteristic of ""warm"") and to greater prosocial behavior of the participant (williams & bargh, 2008)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf44.pdf,"indeed, experiencing affection almost always includes physical warmth (but not vice versa), integrating the sensorimotor experience of physical warmth into the mental representation of affection, but characteristics of the mental representations of affection do not become an integral part of the mental representation of warmth (cf."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf44.pdf,"he showed that close comfort is necessary for healthy psychological functioning, as young rhesus monkeys displayed a greater preference for terry-clothed surrogate mothers as compared to a wire mother, while those raised with a wire mother had greater physiological and psychological problems."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf44.pdf,"some support for this idea seems to be derived from developmental work: priming 18-month old children with touch in the background of a picture (versus no touch) significantly increases helping behavior from those infants later (over & carpenter, 2009)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf44.pdf,we think that having participants interact either with close others or over-including them in the cyberball game has the potential to show the proposed symmetry in temperature changes.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf44.pdf,"this additional process is important also for broader issues concerning relationships, as it may lead to different research strategies in for example treatment of seasonal affective disorder (sad), antisocial personality disorders, or client-patient relationships (see also neumann et al., 2011)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf44.pdf,"in particular, repeated social situations may become ""entrenched,"" in that the situated conceptualization comes to differ from the originally evolved simulator (barsalou, 1999, 2008; schubert & koole, 2009), as in the case of internal working models of relationships (e.g., johnson, dweck, & chen, 2007)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,we found that ostracism's initial distress is not mitigated by being in a group.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"sharing the ostracism experience did mitigate reflective self-reports of belonging, self-esteem, meaning, control and mood."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"moreover, ostracism increased aggression and groups were more aggressive than individuals."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"as reviewed by williams (2009), this body of research indicates that ostracism is a widespread behavior across all social animals, and that it is powerful and painful to individuals who experience it."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"anthropologists and ethologists have argued that ostracism of burdensome members provided evolutionary advantage to those who employed it and thus improved chances for survival (fry, 2007; goodall, 1986; lancaster, 1986)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"similarly, it has been argued that immediate detection of even the subtlest forms of ostracism would provide an advantage to individuals, allowing them to correct their undesired behaviors before full expulsion from the group (kerr & levine, 2008; spoor & williams, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"in fact, williams's model of ostracism (e.g., 2009) has argued that to fully understand responses to ostracism one should distinguish between immediate responses (reflexive impact) that directly assess how individuals experience ostracism and more delayed responses (reflective impact) that assess how individuals subsequently cope."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"the reflexive impact of ostracism supporting the evolutionary contention underlying ostracism theory, research indicates that brief and seemingly innocuous ostracism episodes are sufficient to cause considerable distress."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"for example, ostracism activates regions of the brain associated with detecting the affective distress of pain (eisenberger, lieberman, & williams, 2003) and literally leaves the individual feeling cold (zhong & leonardelli, 2008)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"furthermore, the immediate distress of ostracism is accompanied by threats to at least four fundamental needs: belonging, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"finally, this immediate distress is relatively impervious to cross-cutting factors that logically ought to mitigate the severity to the experience."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,one finding is that coping behavior often has an interpersonal component.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,coping does thus not only affect the target of ostracism but often also those that are responsible or even unrelated others.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"moreover, ostracism theory argues that coping behavior can usually be interpreted as serving the goal of fortifying either belonging and self-esteem, or control and meaningful existence (williams, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"indeed, underscoring the goal of belonging and self-esteem, many studies indicate that ostracized individuals will behave in ways that will improve their inclusionary status."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"moreover, underscoring the goal of control and meaningful existence, considerable research has found antisocial response tendencies by individuals who have been ostracized, excluded, or rejected."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,results showed that social anxiety did not mitigate how individuals experience ostracism; both high and low socially anxious individuals were equally distressed by ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,low anxious individuals were less distressed from ostracism after some time had passed than high anxious individuals.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"moreover, to give another example, results of van beest and williams (2006) showed that money did not mitigate the immediate distress but instead did mitigate delayed interpersonal behaviors."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,individuals who were ostracized from a game that was financially costly were less willing to hurt those who are responsible than individuals who were ostracized from a game that was financially beneficial.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"the present research we set out to test how sharing the ostracism experience would affect intrapersonal distress as measured by threat to basic fundamental needs and mood, and how sharing the ostracism experience would affect interpersonal behavior as measured by interpersonal aggression."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"according to williams' temporal model of ostracism, one could argue that sharing the experience might not mitigate the immediate distress of ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"however, based on social impact theory (latané, 1981), one might actually predict that moving from an interindividual setting to an intergroup setting ought to moderate the immediate experience of ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,social impact theory argues that social interactions take place in a social force field that is governed by the same laws as a physical force field.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,one of the main postulates of this theory is that social impact is defined by the number of targets affected by the impact.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"hence, provided that being ostracized as a group is perceived as being ostracized together with other targets, one could predict that negative reactions to ostracism are decreased when one moves from an interindividual to an intergroup setting."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"on the other hand, social impact theory also acknowledges that social impact is defined by the number of sources exerting the impact."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"hence, provided that being ostracized by a group is perceived as being ostracized by more sources than when one is ostracized by an individual, one could also predict that negative reactions to ostracism are increased when one moves from an interindividual to an intergroup setting."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"on this more reflective level, we argue that the presence of a cotarget offers a way to cope with the negative experience of social exclusion that is not available to individuals who do not have a cotarget."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"the sharing of negative experiences and emotions has been found to promote coping behavior, and even bring people closer together (e.g., collins & miller, 1994; reis & patrick, 1996)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"in a similar vein, research on socially devaluated groups has shown that the shared experience of being discriminated can provide a sense of inclusion that enhances psychological wellbeing (e.g., branscombe, schmitt, & harvey, 1999; spears, jetten, & scheepers, 2002)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"in the current setting, sharing the ostracism experience may thus promote the restoration of the lowered feelings of belonging, self-esteem, perceived control, worthiness, and mood."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"put differently, when people have been able to reflect on the 243 shared ostracism situation, we predict that ostracized individuals in an intergroup context will report less social pain than ostracized individuals in an interindividual context."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,it is interesting that this restored social pain does not imply that ostracized groups should be less motivated to take revenge and exhibit fewer retaliatory behaviors than ostracized individuals.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"indeed, a body of research on the discontinuity effect has repeatedly shown that intergroup interactions are more competitive and often more hostile than interindividual interactions (insko et al., 1998, 2001; wildschut, insko, & pinter, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"although empirical support of this discontinuity effect is typically based on increased competition in prisoners' dilemmas, there is now also increasing evidence that it may also result in more aggression (jaffe & yinon, 1979; meier & hinsz, 2004)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"meier and hinsz (2004), for example, who measured aggressive behavior by means of hot-sauce allocation to hot sauce hating recipients, found clear support for the fact that more aggression was exhibited in intergroup interactions compared to interindividual interactions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"moreover, given that an aggressive response is most likely to occur after a provocation, it may even be anticipated that-compared to solos- dyads are more likely to retaliate when ostracized than when included."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"similar to previous research we recoded the items such that higher ratings indicated more need satisfaction and more positive mood, whereas lower ratings reflect more need threat and more negative mood."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,this is done because data of dyads are not independent.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"so, in the reflexive stage having a cotarget was not a moderating variable in experiencing ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,study 2 study 1 suggests that having a cotarget may not diminish the immediate distress of being ostracized.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,this replicated prior findings on ostracism that immediate reactions are relatively impervious to cross-cutting variables.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"as argued in the general introduction, we predict that having a cotarget may become more relevant when one has time to form a more thorough appraisal of the situation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"we predicted that having a cotarget would increase the extent to which people are willing to hurt those that are responsible, but decrease distress."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"participants in the dyad condition could thus form a joint appraisal because they could interact and talk to each other, whereas participants in the solo condition could only form an individual appraisal."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,overall means and standard deviations are reported in table 2. at this reflexive level we assumed that having a cotarget would not mitigate the experience of being ostracized.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"hence, different than on our measurement of intentions, we now did not observe an increase in the discontinuity effect when people are ostracized."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,we show that having a cotarget did not affect the reflexive stage.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"when participants had more time to form an appraisal of the situation, we observed that groups were less hurt by ostracism than individuals and-consistent with prior research on the discontinuity effect (insko et al., 1998; wildschut et al., 2007)-more willing to lash out than individuals."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,this type of research has shown that partial ostracism is sometimes experienced as complete ostracism but sometimes as complete inclusion.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,results showed that people who were ostracized by both felt as negative as people who were only ostracized by one.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"based on our findings, it is likely that individuals and groups will respond as negative to partial ostracism as to complete ostracism when one considers the immediate experience."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"based on our findings, it is likely that groups would recover from partial ostracism faster than would solos."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"we used social impact theory to argue that impact could be diffused if one considers that our manipulation increases the number of targets that is affected by ostracism, but could also be exacerbated if one considers that our manipulation increases the number of sources that is responsible for the ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"in fact, if one would simply count the number of people that are involved in the situation, one may even conclude that social impact would thus predict no differences."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,is the number of targets or sources increased simply by adding other agents that experience a similar social event or-as we did-by increasing the number of people that control an agent?
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"indeed, manipulating the nature of the groups would introduce a confound because solos cannot have a prior history manipulation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"this literature has shown that discontinuity is not greatly enhanced when one uses triplets or more instead of dyads (wildschut et al., 2007; williams, 2010)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,it is highly likely that aggressive responses are a function not only of the situation but also of the constellation of individual differences that comprise the group.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"as mentioned by leary, kowalski, smith, & phillips (2003), rejected students who turn into school shooters are also characterized by one or more of the three other risk factors that they investigated- psychological problems, an interest in guns and explosives, and a fascination with death."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"our analysis of aggressive intentions showed that the classic discontinuity effect (schopler & insko, 1999; wildschut et al., 2007) is observed more when people are ostracized than when included."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"here we only observed that being ostracized increased aggressive behavior compared to inclusion, and that dyads are more aggressive than solos."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"this difference between intentions and actual behavior may first of all reflect that intentions are but one of the factors instigating actual behavior (sheeran, 2002)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,the fact that groups were more likely to allocate hot sauce even when they were included fits with this explanation.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/vanBeestetalgroupsostracismGD2012.pdf,"as shown in this article, the impact of ostracism on the group can potentially affect intrapersonal and intergroup 251 shared ostracism behavior."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"however, exclusion also increases some affiliative behaviors: ostracism increases participants' tendency to conform (williams, cheung, & choi, 2000) and their cooperation in social dilemmas (ouwerkerk, kerr, gallucci, & van lange, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"also, individuals attend to social information after exclusion (pickett & gardner, 2005), which makes them more likely to take advantage of new affiliative opportunities (e.g., to choose to work with other people rather than alone; maner, dewall, baumeister, & schaller, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"the research reported here explored how people attempt to affiliate after they are excluded, by identifying an automatic nonverbal behavior that addresses threatened belongingness needs."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,these behaviors could reduce the devastating consequences of exclusion with little risk or cost to the rejected person.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"nonconscious behavioral mimicry research on nonconscious behavioral mimicry, or the tendency to mimic other individuals' behaviors without awareness or intent, demonstrates that people mimic others when there is no preexisting rapport and that mimicry can lead to the development of rapport (chartrand, maddux, & lakin, 2005)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"because belongingness is important (baumeister & leary, 1995) and exclusion is threatening (williams, 2007), people should be motivated to engage in affiliative behaviors after exclusion (pickett & gardner, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"although behaving in a prosocial manner could satisfy this objective, prosocial behavior actually decreases after exclusion (twenge, baumeister, dewall, ciarocco, & bartels, 2007), perhaps because it is often effortful and costly (e.g., when it takes the form of monetary donations and future time commitments)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"in contrast, behavioral mimicry would satisfy this affiliative objective in an automatic, low-risk, low-cost way."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"this finding would show that mimicry can be an adaptive response to social exclusion (lakin & chartrand, 2005) and would suggest that mimicry might be the default response when a person needs an easy way to affiliate with others."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"increased mimicry under these circumstances would illustrate the sensitivity of this nonconscious behavior: although social interactions may always trigger some mimicry (chartrand & dalton, in press), selective mimicry following exclusion would mean that mimicry is flexible and strategic despite the fact that it occurs without conscious awareness or intent."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"because they had this information in combination with information about their next interaction partner, we were able to test whether increases in mimicry always follow exclusion, or whether mimicry increases selectively only in particular circumstances."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"because of the relationship between nonconscious mimicry and the development of rapport (lakin, 2006), we expected a threat to belongingness needs (rather than threats to the other three needs) to be related to increases in mimicry."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"we hypothesized (a) that elevated mimicry would occur when participants were excluded by the in-group and the confederate was also a member of the ingroup and (b) that a belongingness threat, but not a threat to any of the other measured needs, would be related to this increase."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,in group excluded participants who interacted with an ingroup confederate were expected to mimic the confederate's foot-moving behavior more than other participants.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,the increase in mimicry when participants interacted with an in-group confederate after being excluded by their in-group was hypothesized to result from a threat to belongingness needs.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"if that is correct, belongingness should have been related to increases in behavioral mimicry, but only when participants interacted with an in-group confederate."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,a traditional mediational analysis was inappropriate in this situation; the interaction of condition and confederate could not predict participants' responses to the belongingness question because this question was answered before the confederate manipulation occurred.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,note that it was only in this condition that mimicry directly addressed threatened belongingness needs.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"although the participants experienced belongingness threat in both the in-groupand the out group exclusion conditions, they reported more belonging to the cyberball group in the in group exclusion condition than in the out group exclusion condition."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,the mimicry data support this interpretation: it was only when participants were excluded by female players and interacted with a female confederate that belongingness correlated with mimicry.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"in other words, although all excluded participants experienced belongingness threat, the participants who felt that they belonged to the excluding group the most were the participants who mimicked the behaviors of a confederate sharing that group membership."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,the results of experiment 2 also suggest that needs other than belongingness were not threatened by exclusion.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"different types of exclusion may have different effects (williams, 2007), and it is possible that the nature of the exclusion in this experiment was particularly related to belongingness."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"alternatively, our results might be explained by williams and zadro's (2005) model of two stages of coping with exclusion, according to which excluded individuals experience threats to belongingness and self-esteem immediately, but experience threats to meaningful existence and control needs only after persistent exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"given the relatively brief exclusion in experiment 2 and the immediate introduction of a new task, it seems reasonable that threats to belongingness would have been most salient."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"although mood became somewhat more negative after exclusion, there was no evidence that mood mediated the relationship between exclusion and increases in behavioral mimicry."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"it is also important to note that even though ostracism by an out-group created as much negative affect as ostracism by an in-group (gonsalkorale & williams, 2007), out-group exclusion resulted in no increased affiliative efforts."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,in-group exclusion might not always motivate mimicry of a confederate sharing that group membership; there are a number of theoretically interesting variables that could moderate this relationship.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"although it is likely that the effects observed here would also be observed for non-genderbased groups, gender may have unique characteristics that are associated with potential moderating variables."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"in this study, it made sense for people to mimic a fellow in-group member not associated with the original exclusion as a way to reestablish themselves in a group that could not be changed."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"when group boundaries are permeable, it might make sense for excluded individuals to switch groups, rather than attempt to affiliate with an in-group member."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"our results may also reflect the fact that the context in experiment 2 was neutral, so the female participants who were excluded by males probably assumed that they had been excluded simply because of their sex."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"variables not directly associated with gender (e.g., status of the excluding group, individual differences in need to belong or group identification) could also moderate the relationship between exclusion and mimicry."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,general discussion this research extends previous work by demonstrating that participants who have recently been excluded exhibit increased nonconscious behavioral mimicry of a new interaction partner (experiment 1).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"moreover, mimicking others' behaviors does not simply create rapport; it may also directly address threatened belongingness needs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"in experiment 2, individuals excluded by an in-group exhibited increased mimicry of the behaviors of a subsequent interaction partner, but only if this partner was also an in-group member."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"as predicted, however, belongingness was related to mimicry, but only when participants were excluded by their in-group and interacted with a member of that in-group."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,this suggests that individuals' desire to be reincluded in their in-group motivated their increased mimicry and that people are selective with their use of mimicry.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"rather than simply mimicking the first person they encounter after being excluded by known persons, individuals increase their mimicry of people who can restore their status within the in-group."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"thus, mimicry can be used flexibly and strategically; it occurs to a greater extent in those situations in which it is most beneficial."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"implications for the literature on exclusion the current research reinforces the idea that the need for belonging is fundamental; individuals routinely engage in behaviors (e.g., mimicry) that help them to address this need."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"the fact that mimicking happens automatically, without conscious awareness or intention, is evidence of the evolutionary criticality of the need to belong; this need is so pervasive that if belongingness could not have been pursued automatically, human ancestors might not have had enough cognitive resources to accomplish other important tasks."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"although previous research has documented that exclusion reduces certain prosocial behaviors (which may be affiliative; twenge et al., 2007), other work has demonstrated an increase in affiliative behaviors that may be intentional or effortful (maner et al., 2007; williams et al., 2000)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf55.pdf,"the nature of the relationship among exclusion, belongingness, and mimicry suggests that individuals may be able to establish themselves in desired groups by mimicking the behaviors of group members and to reestablish themselves in groups from which they have been excluded by mimicking representative group members."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/zhong-leonardelli-2008-cold-and-lonely-does-social-exclusion-literally-feel-cold.pdf,our research suggests one reason why that may be: perhaps cold temperatures in the winter serve as a catalyst to the psychological experience of social exclusion.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,these findings suggest that individuals who score high on empathizing struggle more with the lack of control when involved in an situation where they do not have influence over the social interaction in which they are taking part.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"introduction 1.1. social exclusion social exclusion is the act of being excluded, rejected, or ostracized by others without explicit explanation or negative attention."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"social exclusion is known to generate strong feelings of rejection, social pain, and distress (williams 1997, 2001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"additionally, social exclusion has the unique ability to threaten four fundamental human needs: belonging (baumeister & leary, 1995), self-esteem (baumeister, 1994), control (seligman, 1975), and meaningful existence (for a review see williams, 2001, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"evidence has also shown that individuals seek to increase their sense of belonging, control, self-esteem, and meaningful existence."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"when these needs are lacking individuals experience pathological effects that are more significant than an impulsive distress response (baumeister & leary, 1995)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"while activation was the strongest during the exclusion round, results indicated that the same parts of the brain were activated during the observed round as were activated during the exclusion round."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"this suggests that, participants do not actually have to be purposefully excluded to be negatively affected by exclusion (eisenberger & lieberman, 2004; eisenberger et al., 2003; williams, 1997)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,social exclusion is likely to have been of great evolutionary significance both to the group and to excluded individuals.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,it may have been evolutionarily adaptive for a group to exclude certain individuals as a way to maintain group cohesiveness.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"kurzban and leary (2001) suggest that ostracism goes hand and hand with punishment, and has evolved as a mechanism to protect group members from individuals who violate social norms (e.g."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"for the individual, exclusion can have dire consequences (gruter & masters, 1986; kurzban & leary, 2001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,excluded individuals can become cut off from resources and from protection by the group.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,the potential danger of social exclusion may have led to the development of a response system designed to prevent and counteract social exclusion.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"when individuals are excluded or threatened with exclusion they experience distress, which has been called social pain (eisenberger & lieberman, 2004; eisenberger et al., 2003)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"however, despite the potentially hardwired nature of this response, there is no evidence as to whether this distress response varies as a function of individual differences in social cognition."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"here, we investigate whether proclivity to empathize or systemize has any bearing on the perception and experience of social rejection."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"empathizing can be defined as ''the drive to identify another person's emotions and thoughts and to respond to these with an appropriate emotion"" (baron-cohen, 2003, p. 3)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,without tom there would be considerable difficulty in changing one's behaviour in response to cues and changes in another individual's behaviour or emotional state.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"this does not imply that individuals who rank low on empathy are tom impaired, but there appears to be an important link between empathy and tom."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"females tend to be better at empathizing than males (baroncohen, 2003; goldenfeld et al., 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"if true, the selective pressures are likely to have been very different for each, and could have led to the evolution of different types of cognitive specialization (p."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,it is easy to see how empathizing would be beneficial to mothering and to living peacefully in a small community.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"in fact, many of the advantages gleaned by superior empathizers are directly related to social inclusion, or alternatively avoidance of social exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"additionally, the drive to build a system is also an important part of systemizing."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,systemizing parallels empathizing in two ways: one can occupy differing degrees of systemizing and it is believed to have been selected for during evolution in a similar way as empathizing (i.e.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"the hypothesized advantages associated with increased systemizing ability include using and making tools, hunting, war strategies, social dominance and power, as well as tolerating solitude (baron-cohen, 2003)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,it is of particular interest that tolerating solitude is associated with increased systemizing ability.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,individuals who are better at tolerating solitude would most likely be less driven to socialize and therefore they can devote more of their time to other activities.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"baron-cohen (2003) suggests that in pre-industrial societies, toleration of solitude might have been especially advantageous to hunters who had to go on long journeys in search of food."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"one might speculate that males who hunted for longer may conceivably have been more successful, which would have resulted in more food, and increased chance of survival."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"furthermore, tendency to systemize may engender behaviour that isolates an individual from the rest of the group (e.g., obsessive interest in computers to the exclusion of social activities)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,we hypothesized that individuals categorized as empathizers would report greater levels of distress as a result of being socially excluded during a ball toss game.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"empathizers were predicted to show lower self-reported satisfaction levels of belonging, control, self-esteem, and meaningful existence."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"on the contrary, systemizers were predicted to report that they experienced less distress (self-reported satisfaction levels would not be impacted by exclusion) as a result of exclusion from the ball toss game."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"specifically, we predicted that individuals at the extreme empathizing end of the spectrum will be most distressed by social exclusion, showing the lowest self-reported satisfaction levels of belonging, control, self-esteems, and meaningful existence; and individuals at the extreme systemizing spectrum will be least ''distressed"" by the social exclusion condition."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"individuals who fall into the balanced brain category, meaning they are no more empathic than they are systematic, were predicted to report lower satisfaction levels on the four needs, but not to report levels as low as extreme empathizers or empathizers."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"furthermore, we hypothesized, that balanced brain individuals will report more distress (lower satisfaction on the four needs) than extreme systemizers and systemizers."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,after six throws the game was programmed to stop tossing the ball to the participant; the participant saw the computerized confederates playing amongst themselves but no longer received a throw during this exclusion period.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"in some cases, the questions had to be reverse scored, so that a higher score would be equivalent to a more positive response (e.g."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"in other words, they were significantly more angry and experienced less enjoyment during the cyberball game."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"discussion we found that social exclusion resulted in lower self-reported levels of three out of four hypothesized fundamental needs (belonging, control, and self-esteem) and the supplementary variable (anger (reverse scored), and enjoyment of the cyberball game)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"in addition, we discovered that cognitive style affected participants' responses to the cyberball game."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,individuals with an empathizing and balanced cognitive style reported lowest levels of selfperceived control during the cyberball game and differed significantly from systemizers and extreme systemizers.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,suggest that exclusion from the cyberball game challenges participants' perceived control over the social interaction.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,participants are unable to interact or influence the actions of the other players in an effort to regain inclusion.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"it is not surprising that empathizers report feeling less control, as they may be more sensitive to others' reactions and may be looking for ways to interact or influence the other players, but this is not possible in the game."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"according to baron-cohen (2003) empathetic individuals put themselves in ''the other person's shoes"" and are consistently sensitive to managing social interactions so that others are not hurt or offended."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,empathizers are also able to effortlessly judge when someone else's emotions have changed and to infer why their emotions have changed and what might make them feel better.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"therefore, when empathizers realize that they cannot influence the other players in the game, it seems to result in lower levels of self-perceived control."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"while exclusion accounts for the majority of variance in the four fundamental needs, cognitive style accounts for additional variance for the control need variable."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"in other words, our findings suggest that empathizers have different needs than systemizers in social interactions, particularly in relationship to controlling what occurs in that interaction."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"thus, knowing individual differences in cognitive style adds to our understanding of the impacts of social exclusion on individuals."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"for example, individuals with asperger's syndrome or high functioning autism score highly on systemizing (wheelwright et al., 2006) and we would predict that these individuals would be even less upset by loss of control during exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"furthermore, despite the fact that 78.2% of participants reported that they did not believe that they were playing the game with ''real"" participants our findings showed that individuals were still sensitive to social exclusion in a virtual environment."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"regardless of whether the participants believed that the other players were real, the results bear out our prediction that exclusion from the game would have self-reported negative effects, and are consistent with earlier findings (smith & williams, 2004; williams et al., 2000; zadro et al., 2004)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,this supports the notion that social exclusion has a profound effect on individuals.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,human beings' sensitivity to social exclusion in fact appears to trump the realization that one is being excluded by a computer program.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"some participants may have reacted negatively to being deceived, or may have been embarrased, and may therefore have been reluctant to admit to being deceived by a computer program."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"suggest that because ostracism from a group carries such negative consequences, such as loss of contact with significant others, loss of resources, and possibly death, human beings have evolved a sophisticated set of mechanisms for detecting exclusion and ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,these mechanisms for detecting exclusion prompts emotional responses which motivate us to react and respond in order to regain inclusion into the group or cope with exclusion.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,our findings suggest that the degree to which these emotional responses are mobilized may be partially dependent on cognitive style.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"first, because the study was conducted via the internet, we were unable to control the conditions of participation, including who took part in the study."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,some potential participants were unable to complete the game because they had difficulty loading the game or did not have java installed.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"third, studies (kraut et al., 1998; williams et al., 2000) suggest that individuals who spend time on the internet pursuing social interactions, may be more susceptible to depression and loneliness."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,discovered that spending time on the internet may replace face to face relationships and interactions with weaker and more superficial internet relationships.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,this may result in a decreased sense of belonging for high-frequency internet users.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,"in conclusion, a high empathizing cognitive style is associated with decreased feeling of control during social exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf54.pdf,not all social exclusion is created equal: different types of exclusion lead to qualitatively different responses.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,experiment 1 sought to demonstrate that heightened accessibility leads to aggressive behavior toward the perceived source of the exclusion; whereas experiment 2 sought to demonstrate that increased aggression can be targeted toward others who were not part of the exclusion but were in the same location as the exclusion target.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"in-person exclusion, although unfortunate for the victim, does provide compelling evidence toward the aversive and powerful nature of social exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"because of the inherent difficulties of examining exclusion after the event takes place in a real-life setting, several lines of research have created empirically testable methodologies."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"the game decreased participants' feelings of belonging, control, self-esteem, meaningfulness of life, and magnified negative moods for those who were excluded."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,williams argues that humans have an instinctual drive to fulfill each of these needs.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"players excluded by the computer show decreased feelings of belonging, control, selfesteem, beliefs that life has meaning, and increased negative emotions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"thus, one can argue that exclusion is such a powerful event that even lack of reality in the situation has little effect; hints of exclusion from sources seen, not seen, or not even real, can result in deleterious effects on the ostracized individual."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"the line of research using cyberball has been extended in numerous ways to show how ostracism is perceived, how it changes one's self-concept and alters our view of others."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,work by gonsalkorale and williams (2007) found that the same deleterious 7 effects of ostracism were present even when members of an outgroup exclude the individual.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"a further extension of this area showed that even when a monetary reward was given to individuals during exclusion events and a monetary fine was imposed on inclusion events, the same deleterious effects were found as in previous cyberball studies (van beest & williams, 2006)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"carter-sowell, chen and williams (2008) demonstrated that excluded individuals showed greater social susceptibility than people who were included, and goodwin, williams and carter-sowell (2010) found that ostracism can also be viewed as a form of racism discrimination in certain contexts."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"lastly, eisenberger, lieberman and williams (2003) found that individuals' brains interpret social exclusion similarly to physical pain (via activation of the anterior cingulate cortex)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,these findings help demonstrate that physical and emotional pain are similarly aversive on a biological level.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"furthermore, examining each of these disparate cyberball studies shows that this manipulation is powerful and versatile for creating feelings of exclusion in numerous contexts."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"life-alone task in real-life, face-to-face settings, as well as in cyberball, individuals who are excluded are feeling this way because of a direct exclusion, or perceived direct exclusion, from other people."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"in some conditions, participants were told that based on their personality profile, they would have a life filled with social connectivity (inclusion), whereas other conditions participants receive feedback that their social connections will diminish and finish as they age (exclusion)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"twenge and colleagues reasoned that the feedback creates feelings of inclusion and exclusion, without needing the participant to be explicitly included or excluded by a present moment event or person."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,twenge and colleagues found that the mere anticipation of exclusion was enough to impact the individual.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"self-esteem and feelings of belonging were diminished when the feedback indicated that participants could expect a future alone, in a similar pattern as is seen during face-to-face exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"baumeister, twenge and nuss (2002) extended the findings of the original lifealone task by finding that those who were told they would experience social exclusion in the future had diminished intellectual capacity."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"these findings are important as it shows that like face-to-face ostracism, the life-alone task can bring about swift changes in cognitive and behavioral patterns."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"extending the exploration of behavioral changes following the anticipation of exclusion in the ""life-alone"" task, twenge, baumeister, dewall, ciarocco and bartels (2007) also found that those who thought they would end up alone in life (anticipated exclusion) exhibited less prosocial behaviors than those who were anticipating inclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,this demonstrates that accessibility of behavioral intentions changes for the ostracized.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"the creation and study of this form of ostracism is important as it shows that the anticipation of exclusion alone can bring about powerful changes in the way people view themselves and their social world, and that ostracism can be impactful even in the absence of others."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"furthermore, decreased prosocial behavior 9 corresponds well to the twenge and colleagues (2001) study that found that those who were anticipating a future alone lashed out more aggressively."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"decreased prosocial behavior and increased aggression could both be the result of changes in accessibility, with either decreases in the accessibility of positive self-thoughts, or increases in aggression accessibility."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"as the above research demonstrates, social exclusion negatively affects how one views themselves and their social position in the world, and that this can lead to distinct changes in thought and behavior."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"thus, ostracism in any form can be viewed as a powerful agent of change in human thought and behavior."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"accessibility concept accessibility, or simply accessibility, can be thought of as the degree to which something can be drawn upon cognitively."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"just because a concept is readily available in one's memory and may be drawn upon, does not ensure that concept will be drawn upon most readily in all situations and at all times."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"personal relevance, experience, and contextual issues like one's mood may alter what is most accessible in a given situation (schwarz, 1998)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"availability of course can influence accessibility, however, this relationship can be influenced by a variety of factors."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"factors such as one's current environment, history, and background, may all influence the relationship 10 between accessibility and availability."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"for example, if a child is asked to describe an average grandparent, depending on the experiences upon which the child has to draw, the description they give will likely match one of their own grandparents."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,children's personal context will influence what grandparents are to them.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,their exemplar will likely differ from others due to differing background experiences.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"however, if you were to ask that child 10 years later, that child will likely have a more generalized and robust description because of their continued encounters with other peoples' grandparents."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"experiences will shift what is most accessible, but not necessarily what is available."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"if they have had bad experiences with their grandparents and are in a negative mood, that negative mood may color the perception."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"for example, bargh (1982) found that when examining attention, self-relevant information is recalled more easily, in that greater attention is paid to self-relevant information, and few cognitive resources are needed for this attention."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,they found that depressed individuals were faster at categorizing negative descriptors as applicable to the self than were individuals who were not depressed.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"this demonstrates that although the cognitive load slowed down nondepressed individuals, it only slowed down depressed individuals when the words were not applicable to themselves and of a negative nature."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"when the words were congruent to their depressive state, they were more accessible and more quickly categorized."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"in a seminal paper exploring the concept of accessibility, tversky and kahneman (1973) found that ease of retrieval and familiarity with a concept could have a great impact on the degree to which that concept was drawn on and thus, was cognitively accessible."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,priming one of most common ways to increase accessibility has been through the process of priming.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"across these studies, priming was used as a means to increase accessibility."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"likely, thinking about negative emotions will prime and make negative thoughts more accessible in the present moment."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"further, increased accessibility can act automatically on individuals and alter their perception of the self and others, based upon what was primed, and consequently, what becomes most accessible following the 12 priming."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"after time and cumulative experiences, increased accessibility can lead to thoughts and cognitions that become chronically accessible."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"tversky and kahneman (1973) argued that this can lead to misattributions and mistakes in judgment, because what is chronically accessible may be drawn upon inappropriately"
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"when recalling under easy recall constraints, that which was recalled was made more accessible to the participant, but when recalling under more difficult constraints, the participant did not demonstrate increased accessibility."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"when listing three things (easy retrieval), participants rated themselves as having greater success academically than when listing nine times they were successful, as retrieval was difficult."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"this led to a subsequent behavioral change in that difficult retrieval was viewed as meaning they had less success, and this in turn led to changed behavior, specifically, less success at an academic task."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,nine instances led to greater feelings of success and greater success on an academic abilities task.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"thus, accessibility can alter 13 not only self perceptions but also subsequent behavior."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"furthermore, relative accessibility can create changes in the way one views themself and that one's experiences can influence what is most accessible for a given individual."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"targets of bullying or exclusion can feel negatively about themselves, as an explanation for their experience."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"they may also feel angry about why they were ""chosen"" to be the victim."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,the increased feelings of frustration and negative moods may prime the individual for later aggression.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,the research also supports that those who experience bullying or ostracism in real life often act out aggressively because of their plight.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"sometimes this aggression can be directed toward the self (kaminski & fang, 2009) in the form of self14 harm and suicide, but the aggression also can be directed toward others."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"often, those who were the source of the bullying or exclusion (reijntjes et al., 2010; warburton, williams & cairns, 2003) as well as innocent bystanders (twenge, baumeister, tice, & stucke, 2001) who were not directly involved with the event, may become the target for lashing out through aggressive behavior."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"leary, kowalski, smith, and philips (2003) theorized that exclusion can be a possible trigger in many school shooting occurrences."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,these studies raise the question of whether exclusion might increase the accessibility of aggression.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"accessibility for aggression was manipulated by having guns (a shotgun and .38 revolver) for some participants, or neutral objects such as a badminton racquet, or no stimuli for others."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"it was found that the mere presence of a gun in the room was enough to increase accessibility for aggressive behaviors, in that those who had the weapon present administered significantly longer shocks, than did those with more innocuous (or lack of) stimuli; this was labeled the weapons effect."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"having a weapon made accessible (visible), even though it was not part of the study, caused individuals to have greater cognitive accessibility for weapon-related object or behaviors."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"similar results were 15 found in research by anderson, benjamin and bartholow (1998), who found that being exposed to words related to weapons could serve as a prime to increase accessibility of aggression relevant thinking, and subsequently, increase aggressive behaviors."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"similarly, bartholow and heinz (2006) found that exposure to primes that are not directly associated with aggression or weapons can bring about this effect when those cues are stereotypically related to aggression."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"in their study, exposure to alcohol primes (via a lexical decision task) served to increase accessibility for aggressive behavior, and subsequently, increased behavioral aggression."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"alcohol primes and weapons primes produced statistically similar results, as both increased accessibility for aggression due to their association with aggressive behavior (i.e., weapons are often used as a means to aggress, and drinking often increases aggressive behaviors in individuals)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"in experiment 2, this was extended to show that exposure to alcohol primes resulted in greater interpretation that an ambiguous stimuli was aggressive, compared to controls."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"thus, aggression related cues can serve as a trigger for the accessibility of aggression."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,social exclusion may also be able to trigger this aggression cognition linkage.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,cyberball and life-alone tasks may prime the individual for negative feelings associated with exclusion.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"with exclusion experienced, thoughts related to exclusion, such as retaliation toward those responsible or merely present, may become heightened."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"the exclusion itself may not directly be aggressive, but through spreading activation of concepts, it may nonetheless increase the accessibility of aggressive feelings or behaviors in the excluded individual."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,several studies have found that ostracism events can trigger increased aggression in individuals who were excluded.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"the authors led participants to believe that a confederate, who ostensibly had excluded them in the cyberball game, did not like hot sauce, but that each participant had to administer a small amount to the other participant as part of a subsequent task."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"excluded participants delivered significantly more hot sauce to the confederate than did included participants, ostensibly as a means to ""get back"" at them for the previous exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"it was argued that exclusion served to increase accessibility for aggressive behavior, and much like real-life explorations of schoolyard bullying, the victim of ostracism is primed for more aggressive behavior to attack back at those who ignored them."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"participants who were ""excluded"" by hearing that their personality indicated a future without social connectivity, and who just heard a confederate in the study receive information that their future would have great amounts of social connectivity, were 17 significantly more likely to aggress toward the confederate."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"in other words, the exclusion is reasoned here to have increased the accessibility of aggression behaviors causing participants to lash-out at anyone near them."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"in both the warburton and colleagues (2003) as well as twenge and colleagues (2001) studies, increased aggression was found in those who were excluded, and increased accessibility for aggression based upon being included or excluded was argued to be a fundamental cause of this aggression."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"furthermore, the present research sought to extend the findings of leary and colleagues (2005), who found exclusion to be an antecedent to school shootings, by establishing a causal link between exclusion, accessibility for aggression and negative self-views, changes in selfand world perceptions and increased propensity for aggression."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"previous research (williams, 2007; williams, cheung & choi, 2001; zadro et al., 2004) has shown that social exclusion has a predictable pattern of deleterious effects on those who are excluded."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"these effects can include increased negative affect, decreased feelings of belonging, control, self-esteem, and meaningfulness of life."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"further, research by oberleitner and colleagues (unpublished manuscript) has found that individuals who are excluded via the cyberball ostracism manipulation have several distinct changes in what is most accessible to them."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"research has shown that when excluded, individuals are more likely to attribute neutral stimuli as aggressive (dewall, twenge, gitter, & baumeister, 2009), as well as act out more aggressively (warburton, williams & cairns, 2006)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"specifically, it was hypothesized in experiment 1 that individuals who were excluded would show higher levels of negative affect, less endorsement regarding feelings that they belong, less belief that they have control in their life, less belief that life has meaning, and lowered self-esteem."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"more importantly, it was hypothesized that excluded individuals would respond faster to weapons aggression words than included individuals, and would be slower at responding to positive inclusion related words, as measured via a lexical decision style task."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,it was hypothesized that participants who are excluded via cyberball would report higher levels of state aggression following the task.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"it was also hypothesized that excluded individuals would be faster at categorizing negative self-descriptor words than included individuals, and be slower at categorizing positive self descriptors"
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"furthermore, it was hypothesized that individuals who were excluded would administer more hot sauce, as a behavioral measure of aggression."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"it was also hypothesized that excluded individuals' fundamental needs scores (belonging, control, meaningfulness of life, and self-esteem), and/or their self-reported feelings of aggression would mediate the amount of hot sauce that was administered, as well as their reaction times in the lexical decision task."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"as previously discussed, research by twenge, baumeister, tice, and stucke (2001) found that feelings of social inclusion and exclusion could be induced in the lab via feedback that contained deceptive information."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"the feedback given to participants indicated that based on aspects of their personality, they would have a future social life that was either full of, or absent of, social connections."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"twenge and colleagues (2001) argued that when the personality feedback was given stating the participant would have a future lacking social connections, this feedback induced feelings of social exclusion, with similar effects of cyberball, such as increased negative mood, lowered self-esteem and threat to the need to belong."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"experiment 2 sought to examine how individuals who are either included (personality feedback that the future is full of social connections) or excluded (personality feedback that the future will lack social connections) differ in mood, selfesteem, feelings of belonging, control, and meaningfulness of life."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"further, like experiment 1, experiment 2 examined how included versus excluded individuals may use hot sauce as a proxy for aggression against someone who they feel was just included, but in no way caused their own experience of inclusion exclusion"
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"experiment 2 sought to extend the hypothesized findings in experiment 1 by showing that personality feedback as a method of ostracism can 21 produce changes in accessibility for aggression and negative self-views, and that seeing another participant being included is enough to cause an excluded individual to aggress toward them."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"specifically, for experiment 2 it was hypothesized that individuals who were told they would eventually end up excluded in their lives would show higher levels of negative affect, less endorsement that they belong, have control in their life, that life has meaning, and would report lowered self-esteem."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"furthermore, it was hypothesized that excluded individuals would respond faster to weapons aggression words than would included individuals, and would be slower at responding to positive inclusive words, as measured via a lexical decision task."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"it was hypothesized that excluded individuals would be faster at categorizing negative self-descriptor words than individuals who were included, and would be slower than included individuals at categorizing positive self descriptors"
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"also, it was hypothesized that participants' self-report aggression scores would influence the amount of hot sauce administered, with greater feelings of aggression corresponding to higher amounts of hot sauce administered."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,an information sheet was used to increase the anonymity of the participants and no identifiers were used that would allow responses to be traced to a specific participant.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"following this, the participant and confederate were told that they would each be participating in the same study - this was deception and it was used to make the participant feel they were doing the study with another real participant, and thus, act more naturally in the lab."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"warburton, williams and cairns (2006) found that aggression is more likely after a lack of control situation following exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"a cover story with deception was used, with the research assistant explaining to participants that the audio file was designed to oversaturate their sensory modality of hearing, and that when any of one's sensory modalities have been oversaturated, the remaining four senses are heightened."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,it was explained that this would help them be more accurate in their taste judgments in the upcoming taste-testing task.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"it was further explained that, as there is a positivity bias for things that one creates themselves, they would be creating the bloody mary mix that the other participant would taste, so as to eliminate that positivity bias."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,this was done so that it was obvious to the participant that a spicier bloody mary (with more hot sauce included) would be aversive to the other participant (confederate).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,it was also explained that the audio file was created as a distracter task and to limit feelings of control.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"once reverse coded items were transformed, a sum motive score of the items for each of the constructs was created, with lower scores representing lesser (more ""threatened"") endorsement for that construct (i.e., lowered self-esteem or feelings of belonging)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"thus, the ostracism manipulation was viewed as successfully impacting needs' scores as hypothesized."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"thus, it appears the hypothesis that the ostracism manipulation would increase accessibility for different types of words was not supported."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"it was hypothesized that participants who were excluded would administer more hot sauce to the confederate who they believed had been one of the people in the cyberball game leaving them out, compared to included participants."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"however, when examining the four aggression subscales, hostility was significantly correlated with the amount of hot sauce that was administered (r(46) = .34, p = .02), meaning the more participants endorsed items associated with hostility, the more hot sauce was administered."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"hostility was further significantly correlated with belonging [r(46) = -.35, p = .02), control (r(46) = -.31, p = .04], self-esteem [r(46) = -.513, p < .001], and meaningfulness of life [r(46) = - .41, p = .004], meaning higher scores for hostility were strongly associated with diminished needs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"specifically, the cyberball manipulation hypothesis was met in that excluded (compared to included) participants reported feeling less belonging, control, meaningfulness in their life and self-esteem."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"regarding the hot sauce mediation and gender, it may be the case that the aversive nature of the incident, as well as the evolutionary basis for the negative feelings associated with exclusion, were powerful enough to overcome traditional gender norms regarding aggressive behavior."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"further, it may be that any hint of exclusion is enough to push the individual towards lashing out against others, and that this effect is powerful enough that any changes in the cyberball manipulation checks (fundamental needs) results in strong aggressive responses."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"also, it may be that the accessibility task (modified lexical decision task) was simply too easy for participants, with the traditional word versus nonword discrimination aspect of a true lexical decision task (which was not used in the current study) being needed to see changes in accessibility."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"unpublished 43 manuscript) used only one category of positive and one category of negative words in the task, which may have contributed to the changes in accessibility being more apparent when the data was analyzed."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"an information sheet was used to increase anonymity of participants in that no written record of participants was kept in the lab, and no identifiers were used that could allow for tracing the responses to a specific participant."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"following this, the participant and confederate were jointly told that they would each be participating in the same study - this was deception and it was used to make the participant feel they were doing the study with another real participant, and thus, act more naturally in the lab."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"as with experiment 1, lower scores represented greater feelings of exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"unexpectedly, participants felt more in control when receiving the exclusion feedback (m = 8.13, sd = .900) than did participants who received the inclusion feedback (m = 7.65, sd = 1.112) or no feedback (m = 7.23, sd = 1.134)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"from the above results, there is limited evidence that the life-alone manipulation impacted participants' self-response data."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"analyses on the behavioral dependent variables were still conducted, however, as there may have been demand effects, reactance, or embarrassment associated with the manipulation that kept participants from responding honestly, even though they were still impacted by the manipulation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"thus, there is some behavioral evidence that the anticipation of future exclusion may impact accessibility for negative self descriptive words."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"this may be due to exclusion not influencing the individual difference of rejection sensitivity as, given the evolutionary basis of exclusion, people are highly sensitive to it regardless of experimental condition."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"rejection anxiety, however, may be influenced by condition, as the experience of exclusion is aversive and temporarily results in heightened worry of experiencing exclusion again."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"additionally, participants may have been reactant toward the aversive feedback and thus, made attempts to quell their responses to the exclusion feedback and face valid attempts such as the life-alone measure were thus not sensitive enough to pick up any group difference."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"specifically, the negative self descriptive words did confirm the initial hypothesis that excluded participants would be significantly faster at identifying that word type, compared to participants in the control or inclusion conditions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"given these mixed findings, there may have been certain demand characteristics in the design such that participants were reacting against the negative feedback they received, by not filling out the questionnaires truthfully for how they actually felt."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"the item assessing if participants believed the personality feedback to be true supports this, in that participants reported they believed the feedback significantly less when in the exclusion condition."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"with that, however, they may still (unconsciously) have been affected by the manipulation, which explains why the behavioral measures, which they ostensibly would have less ability to monitor their responses towards, have greater confirmation of the initial hypotheses."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"in experiment 1, the hypothesis regarding self-reports of belonging, control, meaningful existence, self-esteem and mood was confirmed, in that participants who experienced an exclusionary event via the cyberball methodology reported lowered feelings of belonging, control, meaningful existence, less positive selfesteem and increased negative mood states."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"in experiment 2, the hypothesis that excluded participants would report less feelings of belonging, control, meaningful existence, lowered self-esteem and mood, was not supported."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"these findings were highly unexpected, and may imply that newer scale development for generalizable ostracism items are needed."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"these findings are contrary to the manipulation checks used by twenge and colleagues (2001), however this may be due to different measures assessing the same construct being used."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"this may indicate that the manipulation was not successful; however, the rejection anxiety scale did have a significant difference by condition in the expected pattern with excluded participants feeling greater anxiety for rejection, compared to included participants or participants in the control condition."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"the differences seen in rejection anxiety is a novel 67 finding, and does give some support to the life-alone ostracism task having successfully induced feelings of anticipation for inclusion or exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,it may be the case that ostracism is an aversive enough experience that those who experience it develop an immediate (but temporary) increase in anxiety associated with repeating the negative experience.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"it may also prime (increase accessibility) exclusion and the negative feelings associated with it, which might explain this finding."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"by creating a novel new methodology for administering the hot sauce, and not doing it as a form of direct punishment as seen in previous studies, the present research may be useful for future exclusion or aggression studies that want to have an increased masking of behavioral measures of aggression."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"by combining these words types and using all four in the accessibility task in the present study, it may have become too easy for participants to simply select positive versus negative overall, ameliorating the effects."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"more importantly, the behavioral outcome of the hot sauce administration also confirmed the original hypotheses and demonstrated that exclusion increases aggression across different experimental paradigms."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"research has shown (archer, 2004; bjorkqvist, osterman, & lagerspetz, 1994); eagly & steffen, 1986) that there are predictable differences in self-reports of aggression and gender, but these may have been ameliorated by the exclusion methodologies used in each experiment, in that the self-report measures were conducted after the manipulation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"thus, it may be the case that aggression as a trait typically results in differences across gender, but when measuring it as a temporary state following inclusion or exclusion, the manipulation results in the gender effects becoming ameliorated because of the effect of the exclusion manipulation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"further, given that experiment 1 was a direct form of exclusion, and that participants believed the confederate was responsible for that exclusion, it may explain why state hostility was 70 increased for excluded participants, in that they felt more directly hostile towards the other participant."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"this explains why that effect is not present in experiment 2, in that no direct exclusion occurred, and there was no direct person to feel hostile towards, given that the exclusion manipulation was creating ostensibly feelings of anticipation for exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"the lack of a target for hostility results in less state-level hostility, as seen in the self-report aggression measures."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"third, the lack of self-report differences in experiment 2 may have occurred due to participants monitoring their self-report responses to appear unaffected by the manipulation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"it may be the case that unconsciously, the participants were still affected by the manipulation, but had enough cognitive control to enable them to monitor their self-report responses to present that they were not influenced by the personality feedback."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"since the behavioral data still, for the most part, confirmed the original hypotheses, it is likely that participants were still influenced by the manipulation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"in other words, the manipulation may have been successful, but the measurement of self-report data was too easily altered by participants monitoring their responses to appear that they were not influenced by the exclusion feedback."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,it may be the case that the methodology for the present research was too easy for participants and needs to be split up to examine each word type and its opposite pairing more discreetly.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"alternatively, using a traditional lexical decision task, with word versus nonword judgments, as well as only examining positive versus negative self descriptors and then repeating that again with weapons versus positive inclusive words, may result in the expected changes in accessibility becoming more apparent, as was hypothesized."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"by creating a more challenging task for the participants, the changes in accessibility may become more apparent."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"given the lack of replication regarding gender and aggression, it may have been the case that exclusion and inclusion experiences become an equally powerful influence on both genders, resulting in the lack of differences on those measures."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"although experiment 2 found that men had higher state-level reporting of physical aggression, verbal aggression also showed men having higher levels than women, which is often not seen in previous research (see eagly & steffen, 1986, for a review)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"in future works, by administering the measures both before and after the manipulation, differences between state and trait aggression could be seen, and from this, it could be seen how exclusion specifically impacts self-reported feelings of aggression."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"given the interchange ability in the literature regarding the ramifications of bullying and exclusion, measures that could tap into changes in the selfconcept for all of these experiences would be ideal."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"the williams' cyberball items seems to be extremely robust across numerous studies, but the lack of extension and general iz ability to other forms of exclusion is a weakness."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"furthermore, the title given to these items (""fundamental needs"") may be viewed contentiously, as one may argue that numerous aspects of the human psyche are ""fundamental"" to our existence and healthy psychological functioning (or perhaps even more ""fundamental"", i.e., breathing)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"by changing the label, and more importantly, creating items that generalize to any type of 73 exclusion and inclusion event, future research could more easily compare differences between face-to-face exclusion versus the anticipation of exclusion as seen in the lifealone methodology."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"research by maner, dewall, baumeister and schaller (2007) have found that behavior associated with seeking out new social bonds and affiliations is at times an equally probable outcome following exclusion, as is aggressive behavior."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,it may be the case that certain personality traits may push the individual towards one or the other of those outcomes.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"as numerous researchers have found (e.g., baumeister, smart & boden, 1996, for a review; twenge & campbell, 2003) that narcissism can affect how aggressive someone is in response to exclusion, greater attention to the nuances of individuals differences acting in conjunction with different types of exclusion needs to be explored."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"for example, someone high in narcissism may be more ""hurt"" by the life-alone task, which 74 gives them direct negative feedback about who they are, rather than the cyberball task being simply left out of a game, without direct judgment of their personal characteristics"
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"for example, bullying and exclusion have been found to, in some cases, result in the target of the bullying or exclusion acting out aggressively not to others, but to one's self, in the form of cutting or self-harm (i.e., suicide)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"by examining how words and concepts related to self-harm and self-hate may be changed via exclusion, greater understanding of the full changes in the self can be gained."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"furthermore, as mentioned in the previous point, concepts related to helping may also be impacted."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"it may also be the case that different past experiences, and factors such as depression, may affect what becomes most accessible following exclusion and what behaviors are most likely to occur for the victim of exclusion after the experiences has occurred."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,frequency and chronicity of the experiences may also play a role.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"related to this, the life-alone paradigm is intended to be administered to traditional college-age students, given the exclusion feedback discusses lack of social connectivity throughout the life-span."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"although this is an interesting and useful tool for exploring exclusion in a college-aged population, it may not generalize to the population as a whole, given the majority of humans are older than early 20's."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"it may be the case that the language needs updated more completely, rather than just upwardly adjusting the ages as was done in the present study (and limiting the upper age limit as was also done in the present study)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"for example, someone in their late 60's may be able to brush off the negative feedback more easily simply by looking back over their past and 75 seeing that they had, and continue to have, social connections."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"by focusing more specifically on end of life experiences and exclusion associated with those experiences, the paradigm may be of greater use to a wider array of ages, making it more generalizable than the current form."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"as was seen in experiment 2, rejection anxiety was affected by exclusion, but not sensitivity."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"it may be the case that exclusion is an aversive enough experience that everyone has an equal sensitivity to it, especially given the evolutionary consequences for exclusion as was previous discussed (baumeister & leary, 1995)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"however, once one has experienced exclusion, the experience may be aversive enough as to result in the increased anxiety as was seen in experiment 2, creating a fearfulness that one may go through that experience again."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"related to this, exploring how long that increased anxiety is present, may also impact the degree to which changes in accessibility for negative self-views become a chronically accessible concept versus a fleeting change in accessibility."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"given the wide range of findings in the field of exclusion research regarding negative outcomes to exclusion, future studies should attempt to find ways to ameliorate the aversive nature of exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"by finding ways, for example, to alter accessibility towards more positive, rather than negative self-views, or prosocial rather than aggressive access ibi li ties treatments and interventions may be created that could have a practical applicability to the field."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"if, for example, one experiences face-to-face exclusion, and is then given an experience similar to the inclusive life-alone task, it may be the case that the negative consequences of exclusion are not seen, or at least lessened."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"in this variation, however, aggression and punishment is completely absent during the methodology, in that participants believed they were simply taste-testing a spicy beverage, and that they would create the beverage they would give to the confederate, and receive a drink from the confederate to taste."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"the lack of over punishment as part of the task may help reduce priming effects for aggression, result in a truer diagnostic ability for in-lab aggression."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"also, given the taste-test methodology, it may of value to researchers exploring aggression and alcohol use, as it provides for a logical continuation of the study and for measuring aggressive behaviors after alcohol is consumed, or after a placebo administration occurs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"relatedly, it would be interesting to explore how gender differences for who is administering the beverage and who is receiving the beverage may result in different amounts of hot sauce being administered."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,the more natural methodology that takes away the punishment aspect or overt aggression seen in other paradigms may help extend previous findings in this domain.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"by seeing what works and what at times does not work as an outcome of exclusion, future research can continue to engage and explore the cognitive and behavioral changes associated with exclusion, and perhaps find new ways to combat the aversive effects."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"given the pervasive nature of exclusion and the universality of the experience, the greater the knowledge base of exclusion becomes, the greater the chance society will have to create methodologies to support individuals who are experiencing exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"given that some participants were nontraditional university students, ages were adjusted upwardly in the future-alone condition if the participant was obviously older than early 20's."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"the most common of these is a form of bootstrapping (preacher & hayes, 2004) that has been shown to be less stringent than sobel methodology, due to resampling that is able to boost power within the sample."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"given the robust sample size for a cyberball study, it was felt that sobel should be adequate and more appropriate, and lead to less possible spurious results."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf63.pdf,"bootstrapping methodology may be useful for future analyses outside of the present dissertation, where less stringent methodologies (and additional analyses that were not proposed) could be more useful and appropriate."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,previous studies found not only stress but also a decrease in self-esteem to precede the formation of delusions.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"results: after the social stress induction, the eg reported a higher increase in subclinical paranoid beliefs compared to the cg."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,the impact of social stress on paranoid ideation was mediated by a decrease in selfesteem and moderated by proneness to paranoia.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,individuals who felt distressed by paranoid thoughts at baseline were more likely to react with an increase in paranoid ideation under social stress.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"introduction the vulnerability e stress model proposes that stressful lifeevents triggers psychotic episodes in high risk individuals (nuechterlein & dawson, 1984)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"in their heuristic model, preti and cella (2010) propose both ostracism and public discredit to be stressors that elicit negative emotions and precede the formation of delusions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"the importance of ostracism or social exclusion in psychosis has been emphasized in studies that found a higher percentage of psychotic symptoms in individuals with a history of discrimination (janssen et al., 2003) or migration (cantor-graae & selten, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"in addition, it has been shown that high expressed emotion (ee), characterized by emotional over involvement criticism and hostility (magaña et al., 1986) in the patients' families is perceived as stressful by persons with schizophrenia (cutting, aakre, & docherty, 2006) and is associated with relapse (butzlaff & hooley, 1998)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"social stress has also been shown to impact on self-esteem in patients with psychosis as greater stigmatization was found to be related to a greater loss of self-esteem (lysaker, tsai, yanos, & roe, 2008)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"the long-term consequences of stigmatization have been emphasized by ritsher and phelan (2004) who found the stigma of having a mental disorder, especially the feeling of being alienated, to be associated with lower self-esteem at four month follow up."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"in line with the continuum hypothesis of psychotic symptoms (johns & van os, 2001), low self-esteem is also strongly associated with paranoid ideation in the general population (e.g."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"ellett, lopes, & chadwick, 2003) and increases the risk of developing a psychotic episode (krabbendam et al., 2002)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"it seems, therefore, that low self-esteem plays an important role in persecutory delusions both as a vulnerability and as a maintaining factor."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"the interplay between self-esteem and delusions in everyday life has been demonstrated in an experience sampling study which found a decrease in self-esteem to predict the increase of paranoid thoughts (thewissen, bentall, lecomte, van os, & myin-germeys, 2008)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"given that both a decrease in self-esteem and social stress precede the increase of paranoid delusions, one could speculate that reductions in self-esteem mediate rather than directly impact on symptom increase."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,social stressors might activate negative selfevaluations to which patients react with an increase in paranoia.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"the delusional interpretations could arise from attempts to make sense of ambiguous, self threatening situations by interpreting situations consistently with the negative self-image and the negative view of others (fowler et al., 2006)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,they found that the impact of the families' criticism on the patients' positive symptoms was mediated by the patients' negative self evaluation
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,this is advantageous as the impact of social stress on paranoid ideation can be studied without being affected by medication or impairment due to severe symptoms.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,we hypothesized that social stress would directly impact on paranoid ideation (fig.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"a), and that the effect of social stress on paranoid ideation would be moderated by the proneness to positive symptoms and by the proneness to paranoia in particular (fig."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"furthermore, we hypothesized that the direct effect of social stress on paranoid ideation would be mediated by a decrease in self-esteem (fig."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"also, independent t-tests showed that the eg reported having received less ball throws and feeling less integrated during the tossing game than the cg (all p < .001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,this indicates that the level of negative emotions was independent of the order of social stress induction.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"the regression of the social stress condition on the paranoia difference score (r2 ¼ .10, f(1, 75) ¼ 8.46, p ¼ .005) demonstrates that social stress (iv) significantly affects paranoid ideation (dv) so that condition (1) is fulfilled."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,evidence for condition (2) is provided by the second regression analysis which demonstrates that social stress (iv) is significantly associated with the self-esteem difference score (mediator).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,the multiple regression analysis of both social stress and the self-esteem difference score on the paranoia difference score demonstrates that the change in self-esteem (mediator) is associated with an increase in paranoid ideation (dv) when the experimental condition (iv) is controlled for.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"when formally testing the mediation effect by bootstrapping 95% confidence intervals (ci) of the indirect effect, we found the change in self-esteem to significantly mediate the link between social stress and changes in paranoid ideation (ci .45e3.86)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,individuals who were socially excluded and received a negative feedback showed a stronger increase in paranoid thoughts compared to those who were not.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"as hypothesized, paranoid thoughts increased as a consequence of the decrease in self-esteem rather than as a direct reaction to social stress."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,that criticism impacts indirectly on the positive symptoms of psychosis through negative self evaluations
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,the mediating role of a decrease in self-esteem on paranoid ideation cannot be discussed without reference to the psychodynamic ally oriented position that persecutory delusions might serve to defend against low self-esteem.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"bentall, kinderman, and kaney (1994) proposed persecutory delusions to reduce the discrepancy between the actual-self and the ideal-self that is opened up in threat-related situations."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,the finding that self-esteem decreased in response to social stress whereas paranoid ideation increased fits in with the notion that delusions could function to protect the self from further activation of underlying negative selfschemas.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,whether paranoid ideation preserves or even enhances self-esteem could be a topic of future experimental studies.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"alternatively, the association between decreases of self-esteem and increases in paranoid ideation in response to social stress can be interpreted in accordance with the cognitive model of persecutory delusions which postulates that delusions directly reflect feelings of inferiority (freeman et al., 2002)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"this is also consistent with the finding that traumatic experiences that have been shown to increase the risk of developing a psychotic disorder (varese et al., 2012) are associated with both low self-esteem and paranoid ideation (freeman & fowler, 2009; gracie et al., 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,the previous adverse experiences might additionally explain why some persons react to stress with a decrease in self-esteem and a subsequent increase in paranoid ideation while others do not.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"furthermore, an experience sampling study found the degree of vulnerability to be associated with increased psychotic thoughts in reaction to stress: relatives of patients with psychosis reported increases in psychotic experiences in reaction to stressful activities, whereas healthy controls did not (myin-germeys, delespaul, & van os, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,the lack of significance of the cape as a moderator in our study might have been due to the small size of the subsamples in the experimental groups that made moderating effects harder to detect and to the small variability of values of the cape positive scale (sd ¼ .32).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"interestingly, we found that the level of distress associated with baseline paranoia moderated the effect of social stress on paranoid ideation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"it seems, therefore, that the affective aspect of proneness to paranoia is a predictive factor in regard to stress sensitivity"
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"this corroborates with the finding that the distress associated with paranoia rather than the beliefs per se differentiated between patients with delusions and healthy individuals (lincoln, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"as it evokes feelings of exclusion that are assumed to be predominant in paranoia (preti & cella, 2010), it is a feasible experimental feature for the research of the formation of delusions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"also, the interpretation of the finding that the impact of the social stressors on negative emotions is independent of the order they were presented in (exclusion first, criticism first) is restricted by the limited subgroup sample sizes."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"nevertheless, the two social stressors combined impacted on levels of subclinical paranoia."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"furthermore, our study emphasized the relevance of short-term reductions in global self-esteem to the increase in paranoid ideation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"however, previous studies have demonstrated that also specific facets of self-esteem such as positive and negative evaluations of the self (vázquez et al., 2008) and interpersonal selfconcepts (fowler et al., 2006; lincoln, mehl, et al., 2010) play an important role in paranoia."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"in addition, such studies could investigate whether reactions to social stress and decreases in self-esteem affect different facets of paranoia."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"specifically, it might be interesting to investigate whether social stress solely increases general suspiciousness (suspicious thoughts e.g."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"bad things are being said about me behind my back"", freeman et al., 2005) or whether it enhances psychotic paranoia (delusional thoughts, withdrawal, avoidance)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"considering the finding that patients with schizophrenia respond to a simple noise stressor with an increase in paranoid beliefs (moritz et al., 2011), it seems likely that a social stressor might also impact on clinically relevant paranoia and that the decrease in self-esteem is a likely mediator in the equation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"the patients' reaction to social stressors might not only be reflected in decreased self-esteem and paranoid interpretations but also in behavioural reactions such as social withdrawal, which in turn will further decrease self-esteem and increase paranoia."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"in line with vulnerability e stress models (nuechterlein & dawson, 1984), our study confirmed the impact of social stress on the exacerbation of subclinical paranoia in vulnerable individuals."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"this underlines the need for effective prevention programs for persons at higher risk (bechdolf et al., 2005) that promote coping with stress and thereby prevent the onset of psychosis."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"furthermore, our study clearly demonstrates that a reduction in self-esteem rather than social stress per se impacts on the formation of delusions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"therefore, both prevention programs and therapeutic interventions should include techniques that aim at the ability to sustain constant levels of self-esteem under social stress."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,"finally, psychodynamic therapy emphasizes the therapeutic relationship characterized by both empathy and safety to counteract the vulnerable self and as a consequence reduce the need for the proposed defensive mechanism (hingley, 1997)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf50.pdf,future experimental studies might provide insight into whether persons who use the proposed selfesteem enhancing strategies are able to maintain self-esteem and are therefore less likely to develop delusions in socially stressful situations.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf49.pdf,"it has been shown that the inequity inherent in such social compensation can be highly demotivating, particularly when one is compensating for a lazy (rather than a low-ability) partner-we do not like ''playing the sucker'' and doing more than our fair share of the group's work (kerr, 1983)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf41.pdf,"this state of self-awareness can be aversive when there is a discrepancy between people's internal feelings and beliefs and their external behavior (davis & franzoi, 1991; duval & wicklund, 1972; silvia & gendolla, 2001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf41.pdf,"in a recent study, twenge, catanese, and baumeister (2003) proposed that social rejection can lead to the desire to avoid self-awareness because of the discrepancy generated between people's generally positive views of themselves (taylor & brown, 1988) and the experience of being rejected by others."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf41.pdf,this line of reasoning implies that rejected individuals are primarily motivated to avoid socially relevant aspects of the self and that non-social aspects of the self would not be threatening and therefore would not require avoidance.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf41.pdf,a benefit of using the social memory paradigm is that it allowed us to examine attunement to social versus non-social domains and use identical stimuli for the self and other target conditions.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf41.pdf,"an assumption of this paradigm is that the entries that are given greater attention and encoded more deeply are more likely to be recalled (craik & lockhart, 1972)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/s00426-012-0476-2.pdf,our results suggest that this mechanism can be modulated by a social manipulation such as social exclusion.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/s00426-012-0476-2.pdf,"this would explain the lack of sae in the social exclusion extra personal condition, but we should then also expect there to be a lack of sae when the participant has been socially excluded and the object is in her own reaching space."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"while it maintains the strength of the group or individuals employing it, ostracism has the unique capability of threatening at least four fundamental needs: belonging, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence (williams, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"receiving no acknowledgment, response, or involvement from others, the ostracized individual loses his or her sense of belonging."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"self-esteem plummets because self-esteem is at least partly determined by one's social inclusionary status (leary, haupt, strausser, & chokel, 1998; leary, tambor, terdal, & downs, 1995) and because initial reactions involve internalizing and self deprecating explanations (williams, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,control is stripped away because of the non responsiveness of others no matter what the individual does to provoke attention and inclusion.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"finally, existential needs are threatened because the ostracism experience evokes the feeling of invisibility, nonexistence, and unworthiness (case & williams, 2004)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"thus, previous work has demonstrated that the experience of ostracism threatens fundamental needs (williams, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"in addition, researchers have argued that the experience of need threat motivates one to act to ameliorate these effects."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"for example, leary (1999) has proposed that information suggesting that an individual is not valued and accepted by other people motivates behaviors that will increase relational evaluation."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"this model was suggested by harkins's (2006) analysis of the effect of evaluation on performance and argues that evaluation motivates participants to want to perform well, which potentiates whatever response is prepotent, or most likely to be produced, on a given task."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"if the prepotent response is incorrect, and participants do not know, or lack the knowledge or time required for correction, performance is debilitated."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"for example, o'brien and crandall argued that the arousal produced by stereotype threat ""is non-specific and serves to energize behavior in a nondirective way."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"the antisaccade task is an inhibition task that requires participants to respond to a target, but before the target appears, a cue is presented on the opposite side of the display."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"however, participants have a reflexive-like prepotent tendency to orient attention toward the cue."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,this tendency must be inhibited or corrected to optimize performance.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"when combined with eye tracking, the antisaccade task is ideal for studying the processes that culminate in terminal performance because one is able to isolate the contribution of specific processes."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"corrective saccades are the volitional eye movements launched to the target following an incorrect, reflexive saccade toward the cue."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"on those trials in which a participant does not generate a reflexive saccade (i.e., inhibits the prepotent tendency to look at the cue), he or she need only look toward the target."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"both correct and corrective saccades are volitional, meaning that they are endogenously generated; the more motivated one is to see the target, the faster one can generate these eye movements (see jamieson & harkins, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"however, in some cases (e.g., when the participant orients attention toward the cue), the participant's eyes arrive at the target site after target onset."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,these adjusted reaction times directly reflect the participant's level of motivation to press the response key as quickly as possible.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,the mere effort account suggests that the experience of threat arouses the individual and potentiates prepotent responses.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"thus, participants subject to social threat (i.e., stereotype or evaluation threat) are expected to generate more reflexive saccades than controls on antisaccade trials."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"however, because of the motivation resulting from the desire to perform well and the fact that looking toward the cue is an obviously incorrect response, threatened participants should launch correct and corrective (i.e., volitional) saccades faster than controls in an effort to fixate the target as quickly as possible."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"if this were the case, we would find the same pattern of findings as that produced by the potential for evaluation and stereotype threat: increased incidence of reflexive saccades, faster volitional saccades, and faster adjusted reaction time."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"for example, participants could feel anxiety concerning the ostracism experience or performance on the task, and this anxiety could act like a secondary task, occupying central executive processing resources (e.g., roberts, hagar, & heron, 1994)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"if gaze strayed more than 2.82º from the center of the center, that trial was considered as having a bad baseline and was excluded."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"additionally, saccades beginning at 1,000 ms or more after the presentation of the cue were excluded from the data analyses because these eye movements could not have been initiated in response to either the cue or the target."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"however, ample research demonstrates that cyber ball induced ostracism threatens each of these needs, resulting in less belonging, lower self-esteem, less control, and a sense of meaninglessness and invisibility (carter-sowell, chen, & williams, 2008; eisenberger et al., 2003; lakin, chartrand, & arkin, 2008; williams et al., 2000; zadro et al., 2004)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"as shown in table 1, ostracism had a reliable effect on each individual need-threat measure, and significant correlations existed between all need-threat measures (see table 2)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"ostracized participants produced more reflexive saccades (m = 46.14%, sd = 22.98%) than controls (m = 30.46%, sd = 18.87%), t(31) = 2.15, p = .039, d = .77. thus, ostracized participants were at a disadvantage at the outset of antisaccade trials because of their higher incidence of incorrect saccades."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"ostracism did not affect participants' adjusted reaction time, p > .20. again, this finding indicates that the ostracized participants were not more motivated to perform well on the antisaccade task than included participants."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"discussion consistent with the argument that the experience of ostracism represents a threat that potentiates prepotent responses, we found that ostracized participants produced more reflexive saccades than included participants."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"however, those threats also affected motivated behavior (volitional saccade latency and adjusted reaction time), but this was not the case in experiment 1. because ostracized participants made more incorrect reflexive saccades but were not motivated to correct this response, they were slower to fixate the target than included participants."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"as a result, ostracized participants were less accurate in their identifications of target orientation than included participants."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"thus, the experience of need threat could have motivated ostracized participants to demonstrate their self-worth on the saccade tasks in experiment 1, but it did not, as shown by the fact that there are no differences in volitional saccade latencies and adjusted reaction time."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"moreover, this pattern of results was likely not due to ostracized participants experiencing processing deficits as a result of anxiety, because ostracism had no impact on self-reports of anxiety, nor did ostracism slow volitional saccade latencies, which is a consequence of decreasing executive processing capacity (e.g., roberts et al., 1994)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"the pattern of results observed in experiment 1 is consistent with the notion that ostracism represents a social threat that potentiates prepotent responses, but because performance on the antisaccade task does not address the concerns aroused by need threat, ostracized participants are not motivated to perform well."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"in the next experiment, we sought to link the experience of ostracism and performance on the antisaccade task in such a way that performance on the task would provide a means of addressing the concerns produced by need threat."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"thus, ostracized participants in the evaluation condition were expected to make more reflexive saccades than evaluated controls but were predicted to be motivated to correct these responses."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"to summarize, the eye movement data show that under conditions of no evaluation, ostracized participants generated more reflexive saccades than controls and were not motivated to make up for this deficit."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"as a result, ostracized participants were unable to see the target on a greater percentage of trials and thus responded with lower accuracies compared to included participants."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"in the evaluation condition, ostracized participants started antisaccade trials at a disadvantage relative to included participants (more reflexive saccades)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"however, they more than made up for this deficit by launching volitional (correct and corrective) saccades and pressing the key more quickly than included participants, leading to performance facilitation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"discussion as in experiment 1, the experience of ostracism threatened participants' fundamental needs, and replicating the first experiment, the ostracized participants not subject to evaluation generated more reflexive saccades and were less accurate in identifying the target than included participants."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"however, the findings from experiment 2 demonstrate that the effect of ostracism on performance differs as a function of whether performance can be evaluated by the triad of cyberball players."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"consistent with predictions, in the evaluation condition, even though ostracized participants produced more reflexive saccades, they responded to target orientation more quickly than controls because they generated volitional eye movements more quickly and exhibited faster adjusted reaction times than the included participants."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"by linking performance on the antisaccade task to the experience of ostracism, the evaluation manipulation motivated threatened participants to try and perform as well as possible on the cognitive ability (i.e., saccade) task."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"this argument is supported by the mediation analysis, which shows that under evaluation, ostracized participants were motivated to perform well because their fundamental needs, and, more specifically, their need to belong, was threatened."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"thus, the greater the threat to belonging needs that ostracized participants experienced, the more motivated they were to perform well when evaluation by the triad was possible."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,this finding suggests that the ostracized participants were motivated to establish a social bond with the ostracizing others by demonstrating their worth on the cognitive ability tasks.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"this conclusion seems warranted given the fact that the only individuals with whom ostracized participants could forge a social bond in the evaluation condition were the other cyberball ""players"" because they, alone, had access to the participants' scores."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"alternatively, if ostracized participants were trying to take back control of the situation, one would expect threatened control needs to mediate the effect, but this was not the case."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"note that lower (i.e., faster) motivation composite scores indexed an increase in motivation, and lower scores on the belonging needs scale indexed less need satisfaction (i.e., more threat)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"finding threatened needs of belonging, self-esteem, meaningful existence, and control in response to being ostracized via cyberball demonstrates just how sensitive individuals are to threats of exclusion from social groups."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"even when there is no possibility of future interactions with the ostracizing individuals (as in cyberball) and when the group one is being excluded from is illusory, participants are threatened by exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"because performance on the antisaccade task had no apparent relation to the experience of ostracism, need threat did not motivate participants to perform well."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"instead, they responded only to the experience of threat, as evidenced by their increased tendency to launch reflexive saccades toward the cue, leading to lower accuracy than the included participants."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"when subjected to threat, individuals exhibit a pattern of physiological arousal that is characterized by the activation of one or both of the two primary stress systems: the hpa (hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenal) axis and the sam (sympathetic adrenal medullary) axis."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"for example, in a meta-analysis of studies examining cortisol levels in response to acute stressors, dickerson and kemeny (2004) found that exposure to social eva lu at ive threat was associated with heightened levels of cortisol, which is released in response to hpa activation."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"blascovich and mendes (in press) have summarized work in this area as showing that social threat, among other variables (e.g., effort and distress, striving for control, uncertainty, fear), is often associated with moderate to high levels of activity in the hpa and sam axes."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"increases in arousal have long been argued to be associated with the potentiation of prepotent (dominant) responses (e.g., ben-zeev et al., 2005; cottrell, 1972; o'brien & crandall, 2003; zajonc, 1965)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"this potentiation would have been adaptive in our ancestral past because responses to threat would likely require ""flight or fight"" or some other relatively simple behavior that would be facilitated by such potentiation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,in the evaluation condition the experience of ostracism was directly linked to saccade task performance by leading participants to believe that the triad would be able to compare performances.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"when performance was linked to evaluation, participants who were excluded from the game were more motivated to perform well than participants included in cyberball."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"this motivation was reflected in faster volitional saccade latencies and faster adjusted reaction times, which resulted in faster terminal reaction times with no cost in accuracy."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"moreover, experiment 2 demonstrated that the effect of ostracism on motivation in the evaluation condition was mediated by the need for belonging, suggesting that ostracized participants were motivated to affiliate with the group that just excluded them by demonstrating their worth on the cognitive ability task."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,this finding is consistent with leary's (1999) sociometer theory in that performing well on the task could increase relational evaluation.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"it is also consistent with williams's (2009) temporal need-threat model, which argues that participants strive to resolve or cope with threatened fundamental needs after the experience of ostracism."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"in their research, ostracized individuals were more likely to conform to group norms in an effort to satisfy their belonging needs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"other research has demonstrated that after being rejected, individuals strive to establish social bonds by assigning greater rewards to those with whom they will interact in the future (maner, dewall, baumeister, & schaller, 2007)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,this analysis suggests that participants are motivated to respond to the concerns produced by the ostracism and take advantage of the avenue(s) that are available to them.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"in experiment 1, ostracized individuals suffered from need threat and performance debilitation when the performance situation was dissociated from the experience of ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"however, by linking performance to ostracism in experiment 2, we provided an avenue that ostracized participants could use to fortify their threatened fundamental needs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"under these circumstances, ostracized participants could respond to the concerns produced by need threat by performing well, which is a means to improve one's inclusionary status (baumeister & leary, 1995)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf45.pdf,"evaluation created a link between the performance situation and the experience of ostracism, and threats to belonging needs directly led to increases in motivation following ostracism."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"in addition, this research demonstrates that nonconscious mimicry is selective and sensitive to context."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"violence (e.g., the shootings at virginia tech) is often assumed to be partially caused by social isolation, and as a result, recent violent incidents have increased research interest in the consequences of exclusion."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"however, exclusion also increases some affiliative behaviors: ostracism increases participants' tendency to conform (williams, cheung, & choi, 2000) and their cooperation in social dilemmas (ouwerkerk, kerr, gallucci, & van lange, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"also, individuals attend to social information after exclusion (pickett & gardner, 2005), which makes them more likely to take advantage of new affiliative opportunities (e.g., to choose to work with other people rather than alone; maner, dewall, baumeister, & schaller, 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"the research reported here explored how people attempt to affiliate after they are excluded, by identifying an automatic nonverbal behavior that addresses threatened belongingness needs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"although excluded people are motivated to affiliate, their affiliative behaviors often are conscious, require great effort, or are high in cost (maner et al., 2007; williams et al., 2000)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"attempts to affiliate in subtle, nonverbal ways are unlikely to be met with new or continued rejection."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"moreover, given that self-regulation and cognitive resources suffer after exclusion (baumeister, dewall, ciarocco, & twenge, 2005; baumeister, twenge, & nuss, 2002), automatic affiliative behaviors would be especially functional because they require few, if any, conscious resources."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,these behaviors could reduce the devastating consequences of exclusion with little risk or cost to the rejected person.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"nonconscious behavioral mimicry research on nonconscious behavioral mimicry, or the tendency to mimic other individuals' behaviors without awareness or intent, demonstrates that people mimic others when there is no preexisting rapport and that mimicry can lead to the development of rapport (chartrand, maddux, & lakin, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"both conscious and nonconscious affiliation goals can be pursued successfully by mimicking others (lakin & chartrand, 2003)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"because belongingness is important (baumeister & leary, 1995) and exclusion is threatening (williams, 2007), people should be motivated to engage in affiliative behaviors after exclusion (pickett & gardner, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"although behaving in a prosocial manner could satisfy this objective, prosocial behavior actually decreases after exclusion (twenge, baumeister, dewall, ciarocco, & bartels, 2007), perhaps because it is often effortful and costly (e.g., when it takes the form of monetary donations and future time commitments)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"in contrast, behavioral mimicry would satisfy this affiliative objective in an automatic, low-risk, low-cost way."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"this finding would show that mimicry can be an adaptive response to social exclusion (lakin & chartrand, 2005) and would suggest that mimicry might be the default response when a person needs an easy way to affiliate with others."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,mood was not affected by exclusion and therefore cannot be responsible for the observed increase in behavioral mimicry.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,experiment 1 demonstrated that being excluded by unknown others increases nonconscious behavioral mimicry.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"because excluded participants had no information about their excluders, they pursued a logical course of behavior, even if they did so automatically, by affiliating with a subsequent interaction partner."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"this would be consistent with excluded individuals having an increased desire to affiliate, and would suggest that automatic mimicry occurs whenever the need to affiliate exists and the opportunity arises."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"however, another possibility is that mimicry is more selective: perhaps excluded people use this automatic behavior only under particular circumstances."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"presumably, a need to affiliate was activated by exclusion, and the confederate was someone with whom participants could develop a positive relationship."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"but when individuals have more information about the people who exclude them, mimicry may increase only when threatened identities can be reestablished."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"that is, mimicry may increase only if the person who can be mimicked shares a salient characteristic with both the person who was excluded and members of the excluding group."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"increased mimicry under these circumstances would illustrate the sensitivity of this nonconscious behavior: although social interactions may always trigger some mimicry (chartrand & dalton, in press), selective mimicry following exclusion would mean that mimicry is flexible and strategic despite the fact that it occurs without conscious awareness or intent."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"because they had this information in combination with information about their next interaction partner, we were able to test whether increases in mimicry always follow exclusion, or whether mimicry increases selectively only in particular circumstances."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"because of the relationship between nonconscious mimicry and the development of rapport (lakin, 2006), we expected a threat to belongingness needs (rather than threats to the other three needs) to be related to increases in mimicry."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"we hypothesized (a) that elevated mimicry would occur when participants were excluded by the in-group and the confederate was also a member of the ingroup and (b) that a belongingness threat, but not a threat to any of the other measured needs, would be related to this increase."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,in group excluded participants who interacted with an ingroup confederate were expected to mimic the confederate's foot-moving behavior more than other participants.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,the increase in mimicry when participants interacted with an in-group confederate after being excluded by their in-group was hypothesized to result from a threat to belongingness needs.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"if that is correct, belongingness should have been related to increases in behavioral mimicry, but only when participants interacted with an in-group confederate."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,a traditional mediational analysis was inappropriate in this situation; the interaction of condition and confederate could not predict participants' responses to the belongingness question because this question was answered before the confederate manipulation occurred.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,note that it was only in this condition that mimicry directly addressed threatened belongingness needs.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"although the participants experienced belongingness threat in both the in-groupand the out group exclusion conditions, they reported more belonging to the cyberball group in the in group exclusion condition than in the out group exclusion condition."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,the mimicry data support this interpretation: it was only when participants were excluded by female players and interacted with a female confederate that belongingness correlated with mimicry.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"in other words, although all excluded participants experienced belongingness threat, the participants who felt that they belonged to the excluding group the most were the participants who mimicked the behaviors of a confederate sharing that group membership."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,the results of experiment 2 also suggest that needs other than belongingness were not threatened by exclusion.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"different types of exclusion may have different effects (williams, 2007), and it is possible that the nature of the exclusion in this experiment was particularly related to belongingness."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"alternatively, our results might be explained by williams and zadro's (2005) model of two stages of coping with exclusion, according to which excluded individuals experience threats to belongingness and self-esteem immediately, but experience threats to meaningful existence and control needs only after persistent exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"given the relatively brief exclusion in experiment 2 and the immediate introduction of a new task, it seems reasonable that threats to belongingness would have been most salient."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"although mood became somewhat more negative after exclusion, there was no evidence that mood mediated the relationship between exclusion and increases in behavioral mimicry."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"it is also important to note that even though ostracism by an out-group created as much negative affect as ostracism by an in-group (gonsalkorale & williams, 2007), out-group exclusion resulted in no increased affiliative efforts."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,in-group exclusion might not always motivate mimicry of a confederate sharing that group membership; there are a number of theoretically interesting variables that could moderate this relationship.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"although it is likely that the effects observed here would also be observed for non-genderbased groups, gender may have unique characteristics that are associated with potential moderating variables."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"in this study, it made sense for people to mimic a fellow in-group member not associated with the original exclusion as a way to reestablish themselves in a group that could not be changed."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"when group boundaries are permeable, it might make sense for excluded individuals to switch groups, rather than attempt to affiliate with an in-group member."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"our results may also reflect the fact that the context in experiment 2 was neutral, so the female participants who were excluded by males probably assumed that they had been excluded simply because of their sex."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"variables not directly associated with gender (e.g., status of the excluding group, individual differences in need to belong or group identification) could also moderate the relationship between exclusion and mimicry."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,general discussion this research extends previous work by demonstrating that participants who have recently been excluded exhibit increased nonconscious behavioral mimicry of a new interaction partner (experiment 1).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"moreover, mimicking others' behaviors does not simply create rapport; it may also directly address threatened belongingness needs."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"in experiment 2, individuals excluded by an in-group exhibited increased mimicry of the behaviors of a subsequent interaction partner, but only if this partner was also an in-group member."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"as predicted, however, belongingness was related to mimicry, but only when participants were excluded by their in-group and interacted with a member of that in-group."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,this suggests that individuals' desire to be reincluded in their in-group motivated their increased mimicry and that people are selective with their use of mimicry.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"rather than simply mimicking the first person they encounter after being excluded by known persons, individuals increase their mimicry of people who can restore their status within the in-group."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"thus, mimicry can be used flexibly and strategically; it occurs to a greater extent in those situations in which it is most beneficial."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"implications for the literature on exclusion the current research reinforces the idea that the need for belonging is fundamental; individuals routinely engage in behaviors (e.g., mimicry) that help them to address this need."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"the fact that mimicking happens automatically, without conscious awareness or intention, is evidence of the evolutionary criticality of the need to belong; this need is so pervasive that if belongingness could not have been pursued automatically, human ancestors might not have had enough cognitive resources to accomplish other important tasks."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"although previous research has documented that exclusion reduces certain prosocial behaviors (which may be affiliative; twenge et al., 2007), other work has demonstrated an increase in affiliative behaviors that may be intentional or effortful (maner et al., 2007; williams et al., 2000)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf56.pdf,"the nature of the relationship among exclusion, belongingness, and mimicry suggests that individuals may be able to establish themselves in desired groups by mimicking the behaviors of group members and to reestablish themselves in groups from which they have been excluded by mimicking representative group members."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"according to williams' (2001; williams & sommer, 1997) model, ostracism is unique relative to other aversive social experiences because it affects four basic human needs: the need to belong, the need for self-esteem, the need for control, and the need for meaningful existence."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"the persistence of negative psychological effects are mediated by factors such as high social anxiety (oaten, williams, jones, & zadro, 2008; zadro et al., 2006), and the way in which participants remember the ostracism experience (lau, moulds, & richardson, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"furthermore, neuroimaging techniques have indicated that the pattern of neural activation that occurs when participants are ostracized is similar to the pattern of neural activation that occurs when participants experience physical pain (eisenberger, lieberman, & williams, 2003)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"they found that, although both groups experienced the negative effects of ostracism, participants with high levels of social anxiety took longer to recover from the effects of ostracism than did non-anxious participants (see also oaten et al., 2008)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,these findings suggest that at least one sub-group of the general population may be more susceptible to the negative effects of ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,another sub-group of the population for whom ostracism could have particularly negative effects are adolescents.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"during this developmental stage, the social focus switches from parent-centered to more peer-centered relationships, and the majority of social support is gained from peers (storch et al., 2005; sullivan et al., 2006)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"consequently, one of the primary desires during adolescence is to identify with a peer group, and to be socially accepted (sullivan et al., 2006)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,a number of non experimental studies have confirmed that social exclusion can have a negative effect on adolescent social development.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"furthermore, exclusion was positively correlated with an increase in negative behavior including delinquency (stealing, damaging others' property, or skipping school), cigarette use, and alcohol use."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,they found a positive correlation between relational victimization (which includes ostracism or shunning) and the development of social phobia symptoms 1 year later.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"williams' cyberball paradigm provides an excellent tool to study age-related differences in ostracism because (1) ostracism can be experimentally manipulated and measured, and (2) the same procedure can easily be used with participants of different ages."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"furthermore, socio-cultural changes that have taken place over the past 50 years have prolonged the period of dependence for most individuals in the western world."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"given the niche of emerging adults, we predict that, like adolescents, they may be particularly susceptible to the negative effects of ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"first, unlike prior research with this paradigm in which participants were recruited individually and told that they were playing anonymous players over a network, we increased the ecological validity of the manipulation by recruiting participants in groups of four close friends."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"all found that, after playing cyberball, ostracized participants (adolescents, undergraduate university students, and adults) reported lower levels of self-esteem relative to included participants."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"items measuring belonging, meaningful existence, anger, and bad mood were reverse scored such that lower scores for each measure reflected a stronger negative effect and a greater need threat."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"for ostracized participants, on the other hand, the adolescents and emerging adults exhibited lower scores (i.e., more need threat) than did the young adults."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"this common practice is due primarily to the fact that administering the basic needs questionnaire to participants both before and after the manipulation potentially highlights the nature of the manipulation, which could then skew participants' responses."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"if we consider the post-cyberball scores of the ostracized participants in particular, emerging adults reported significantly lower levels of self-esteem than did the adolescents who, in turn, reported significantly lower levels of self-esteem than did the young adults."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"irrespective of their age, ostracized participants displayed significantly more need threat relative to the included participants."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"consistent with our hypotheses, both adolescents and emerging adults experienced a higher degree of need threat and a larger decline in self-esteem relative to young adults."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"in fact, ostracized emerging adults displayed a larger decrease in their self-esteem than did their younger, adolescent counterparts."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"age and ostracism 33 sample may help to explain their increased sensitivity to ostracism, particularly with respect to self-esteem."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"in hindsight, then, it is probably not surprising that the emerging adults in our sample were even more susceptible to the effects of ostracism on self-esteem than were the other two age groups."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"this finding also raises the possibility that people of all ages might be particularly susceptible to ostracism following a major social transition (e.g., moving to a new school, starting a new job)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"in addition to the effects on the four basic needs, we also found that ostracism influenced participants' self-reported mood levels."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"in the present experiment, ostracized participants of all ages reported higher levels of hurt feelings and anger, lower feelings of good mood, and higher feelings of bad mood than did included participants."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,it is possible that the large effect of ostracism on negative mood reported in this experiment was due to the nature of our recruitment procedure.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,it is also possible that participants' mood ratings were mediated by their need threat.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"previous studies have shown that higher levels of need threat are associated with greater mood effects (van beest & williams, 2006)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"that is, the consistently large effects on basic needs scores that we observed here may have also contributed to the large mood effects we observed as well."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"the issue of negative mood is particularly relevant during adolescence and emerging adulthood (goossens, 2006; larson & richards, 1994; meece & daniels, 2008), and therefore the conditions under which ostracism does and does not lead to changes in negative mood clearly warrants further research."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"that is, irrespective of whether they are ostracized by friends or strangers, adolescent mood is highly affected by exclusion, but there may be some point in development when adults are more resilient to the effects of ostracism on mood (at least by strangers)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"despite the relatively benign nature of the cyberball task, the participants in our sample were negatively affected by being ostracized in this brief internet game, and the effects of ostracism on their basic needs and their mood were consistently large."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"although bullying is a commonly acknowledged problem in many schools, bullying is typically defined as physical or verbal abuse such as hitting or name-calling (smith & brain, 2000)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"it is important to note, however, that ostracism also commonly occurs at school."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"in contrast to overt forms of bullying such as hitting, ostracism has no obvious external signs, and may therefore be more difficult for teachers and other adults to detect and stop."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf65.pdf,"ostracism sometimes leads to internalizing behavior problems such as suicide (cleary, 2000), and externalizing behavior problems such as increased aggression and delinquency (chow, tiedens, & goval, 2008; kuperschmidt, burchinal, & patterson, 1995; leary et al., 2003)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"by integrating research on empathy gaps for physical pain (loewenstein, 1996) with social pain theory (macdonald & leary, 2005), the authors generated the hypothesis that people generally underestimate the severity of social pain (ostracism, shame, etc."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,a biased judgment that is only corrected when people actively experience social pain for themselves.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"using a social exclusion manipulation, studies 1-4 found that nonexcluded participants consistently underestimated the severity of social pain compared with excluded participants, who had a heightened appreciation for social pain."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,this empathy gap for social pain occurred when participants evaluated both the pain of others (interpersonal empathy gap) as well as the pain participants themselves experienced in the past (intrapersonal empathy gap).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,the authors argue that beliefs about social pain are important because they govern how people react to socially distressing events.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"this revealed that actively experiencing social pain heightened the estimated pain of emotional bullying, which in turn led teachers to recommend both more comprehensive treatment for bullied students and greater punishment for students who bully."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"when a teacher asked jenny how the taunting makes her feel, she said, ""it hurts."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"indeed, reactions to social exclusion mirror the consequences of physical injury, such as temporary numbness (dewall & baumeister, 2006) and heightened aggressiveness (twenge, baumeister, tice, & stucke, 2001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,perhaps the best evidence for the overlap between physical and social pain in humans comes from research showing that responses to both forms of injury appear to share a number of physiological mechanisms.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"yet, in this article, we argue that people systematically underestimate the severity of social pain, and their biased estimate is only corrected when people actively experience social pain for themselves."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"empathy gaps for physical pain numerous studies have found that people tend to exhibit what loewenstein (1996) has termed a cold-to-hot empathy gap: the tendency for people in a cold state (i.e., not experiencing hunger, pain, sexual arousal, etc.)"

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,loewenstein (1996) has argued that the underestimation of visceral states is due to people's constrained memory for visceral experience.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,there is also evidence that patients underestimate the severity of the pain associated with upcoming medical procedures.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"for example, one study found that the majority of pregnant women who intended to go without anesthesia during childbirth reversed their decisions once they went into labor, suggesting that they had initially underestimated the intensity of the pain of childbirth christensen sz alan ski 1984)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"consistent with the cold-to-hot empathy gap, participants who experienced the pain while they made their decision demanded higher compensation than did those who experienced the pain just 1 week earlier."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,study 4 examined whether people would exhibit empathy gaps when recalling a time when they themselves were socially excluded-an intrapersonal empathy gap for social pain.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,we believe that the biased estimate of social pain is important because it governs how people react to socially distressing events.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"in study 5, we examined how the underestimation of social pain affects teachers' policies toward emotional bullying in school."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,study 1 study 1 tested the hypothesis that people not actively experiencing social pain would consider socially distressing events to be less painful compared with people who are actively experiencing social pain.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,we predicted that participants who were excluded would estimate socially painful events to be more painful relative to participants who were not excluded.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"the faces vary in terms of the magnitude of pain they express, with higher scores reflecting greater pain."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"we explain our effects in terms of the enhanced perspective taking of the exclusion condition-by actively experiencing social pain, individuals can understand its motivational force in a way that cold state participants cannot."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,another explanation for this finding is that inducing social pain has a generalized effect on decision making.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"for example, social pain might have served as information across all the events, leading participants in the exclusion condition to rate all of the negative events as more painful."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"study 2 in study 1, we found that people who were actively experiencing social pain had a heightened estimate of the pain of social suffering."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,we argue that people have difficulty appreciating the full severity of social suffering unless they themselves are actively experiencing social pain.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,that any aversive experience-and not specifically social pain- would elevate estimates of social suffering.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"we predicted that although participants in both the exclusion and the negative feedback conditions would find cyberball to be a negative experience, only participants who were experiencing social pain (i.e., in the exclusion condition) would have heightened pain estimates."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,this was done to ensure that any differences related to the negative feedback condition could not be attributed to a lack of exposure to the cyberball task.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"when they do interact, they often tease her for being overweight and wearing unfashionable clothes."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,we predicted that participants in the exclusion condition would judge the social exclusion scenario to be more painful compared with participants in both the inclusion and the negative feedback conditions.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"in study 1, we found that those who were actively experiencing social pain (i.e., exclusion condition) rated socially distressing events (but not other negative events) to be more painful compared with people who were not actively experiencing social pain (i.e., an inclusion and control condition)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"in study 2, we found that general negative feedback did not heighten estimates of social pain."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,only actively experiencing social pain seems to heighten people's understanding of social suffering.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"after all, it could be that the excluded participants overestimated the severity of the socially painful events-although this interpretation would run against the empathy gaps for physical pain literature."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,this was done to manipulate the degree of (vicarious) social pain the observers would experience while watching cyberball.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,we predicted that the low identification observers would experience little social pain while watching their partner be ostracized and would therefore underestimate the pain their partner experienced.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"however, we predicted that the high identification observers would experience social pain while watching their partner be ostracized and would therefore provide a more accurate assessment of their partner's pain."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"one of our concerns was that high identifiers might communicate with their partner more than low identifiers would, which could provide an alternate explanation for differences in accuracy for estimated pain."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,study 4 study 3 provides evidence for an interpersonal empathy gap for social pain: people who were not actively experiencing social pain under appreciated the severity of another's suffering.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"in study 4, we examined whether people would exhibit empathy gaps when recalling a time when they themselves were socially excluded-an intrapersonal empathy gap for social pain."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"on the basis of the empathy gap finding that people need to actively experience visceral states to appreciate their motivational force, we predicted that participants who were initially excluded would, 1 week later, underestimate the severity of their reaction to the cyberball task experienced a week earlier."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"because we could not reveal the nature of the study until after participants completed the second session, participants were not fully debriefed about cyberball during the first session."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"instead, each participant received positive social feedback at the end of the first session in an effort to repair any feelings of exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"thus, in line with the empathy gap finding that people need to actively experience pain to appreciate its motivational force, we found that participants who were initially excluded had difficulty appreciating the severity of social pain experienced in the cyberball task just 1 week later."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,study 4 thus replicates our early finding that people who are not experiencing social pain objectively underestimate its severity.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,that people continue to underestimate the severity of painful events they have already experienced suggests that empathy gaps for social pain are quite robust.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,beliefs about social pain are important because they strongly influence people's reaction to socially painful events and guide their approach to the many decisions and policies that address socially painful experiences.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,we predicted that teachers who experienced social exclusion for themselves would have a heightened perception of the pain of emotional bullying-a heightened perception that would lead to more stern punishment for students who bully and more comprehensive treatment for bullied students.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"in other words, we expected that the perceived pain of emotional bullying would mediate the effect of condition on both punishment and treatment recommendations"
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"when they do interact, they often tease her for being overweight and wearing unfashionable clothes."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"third, the relationship between condition assignment and punishment recommendation diminished when the perceived severity of emotional bullying (the mediator) was included in the regression ( .23, p .25) (sobel test, z 2.13, p .03)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"likewise, the relationship between condition assignment and treatment recommendation diminished when severity of emotional bullying (the mediator) was included in the regression ( .24, p .11; sobel test, z 2.08, p .04)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,we found that actively experiencing social pain heightened the perceived pain of emotional bullying.

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,we believe that the tendency to underestimate the severity of social pain has numerous implications beyond school bullying.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"for example, the distorted judgments of social pain may interfere with the resolution of conflicts in interpersonal relationships."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,our findings suggest that people may inadequately empathize with those who are coping with social pain.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"along these lines, we are currently examining how the underestimation of social pain impacts company policy for issues like bereavement leave and employee victimization."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"although we believe that the misappraisal of social pain has many negative consequences, it may carry some benefits."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,an inability to appreciate the full emotional consequences of social pain may be an important facilitator of potentially risky social approach behaviors such as asking for a first date or leaving home for college.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"indeed, an empathy gap for one's past social pain may be crucial in recovering from traumatic interpersonal events."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,it is thus unclear to what extent the empathy gap findings would hold for exclusion experiences that lead to emotional numbness.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"although the current work suggests that individuals not experiencing social pain have difficulty appreciating social suffering, a related question is whether individuals experiencing social pain have an empathy gap for feeling included."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"if excluded individuals underestimate the relief that would come from pursuing opportunities for connection, this form of empathy gap may decrease motivation for social behaviors likely to ameliorate feelings of social pain."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"indeed, excluded individuals appear to engage in antisocial behaviors (e.g., twenge et al., 2001) and fail to engage in prosocial behaviors (e.g., twenge, baumeister, dewall, ciarocco, & bartels, 2007), in a manner that may interfere with the pursuit of inclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"further, hurt individuals who have trouble appreciating what sorts of decisions they may make when the pain passes, or even those who have trouble appreciating that it is possible to feel something other than hurt, might be prone to self-harming behaviors like suicide."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"the realization that physicians tend to underestimate the severity of pain has shifted the guidelines for the administration of anesthetic for a variety of medical procedures (rupp & delaney, 2004)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"a related solution has been for physicians to acknowledge that patients have a better understanding of their own pain than physicians can and thus prescribe anesthetic on the basis of the patient's report of pain intensity (decosterd et al., 2007)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"finally, in a few cases, obstetricians are trying to correct expecting mothers' perceptions of labor pain by allowing them to feel physical pain (by putting their arm in ice water) before deciding to forgo anesthetic during labor."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"for example, schools might acknowledge this bias and adjust their policies accordingly (e.g., offering more counseling for emotionally bullied students)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"or companies might design a bereavement leave policy that reflects the judgment of the grieving employee, as opposed to the judgment of a human resource manager."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,a final approach might be to self-induce mild states of social pain as a way to improve understanding of other's pain.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf60.pdf,"it is encouraging that a recent study found that people seem to have some capacity to self-induce the feeling of social pain by relieving past socially distressing events (chen, williams, fitness, & newton, 2008)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,these forms of punishment persist throughout history because ostracism has powerful psychological effects.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"ostracism is defined as the experience of ""being ignored and excluded, often without excessive explanation or explicit negative attention"" (williams, 2007b, p. 429)."

/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"while experiencing ostracism from anyone is uncomfortable, being ostracized by members of groups for which people have permanent membership takes people longer to recover psychologically (wirth & williams, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"the psychological discomfort occurs even when being ostracized is accompanied by benefits such as monetary gain (van beest & williams, 2006)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"eisenberger, lieberman, and williams (2003) found from viewing neuroimages that the anterior cingulate cortex was more activated for those who were 2 ostracized."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"this region is activated when individuals experience pain, which led eisbenberger and colleagues to conclude that social pain is comparable to physical pain."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"while physical pain serves to alert of harm to the body, social pain serves to alert of harm to social connections."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"based on the model developed by williams (2007b), individuals who experience ostracism report declines in four distinct areas of psychological wellbeing: (a) sense of belonging, (b) self-esteem, (c) perceived control, and (d) meaningful existence."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,richman and leary (2009) assert that perceived control and meaningful existence may be threatened in instances unrelated to ostracism and can be viewed as secondary effects.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"all forms of ostracism seem to directly influence two areas of psychological wellbeing: 1) sense of belonging and, 2) self-esteem."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"disapproval by others impacts how people feel about themselves, even for people who believe evaluations by others do not affect their self-esteem (leary et al., 2003)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,effects of ostracism on psychological well-being experiencing ostracism can affect people beyond threatening their need to belong and their level of self-esteem.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"although many instances of ostracism are brief, it can be experienced for long durations."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"people experiencing years of the ""silent treatment"" report reactions including depression, paranoia, eating disorders, and suicide attempts (williams, 1997)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"experiencing ostracism on a long-term basis can lead people to believe they are unworthy of attention and to perceive their life situation as unalterable, developing a sense of learned helplessness (williams, 2007a)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"the social pains of ostracism may also exacerbate pain-related disorders (macdonald & leary, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"ostracism may be linked with heightened suicide risk (twenge, catanese, & baumeister, 2002)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"similar to findings in suicidal individuals, those who are ostracized appear to adopt a protective cognitive distancing to avoid thoughts about their self-worth."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"hurt feelings and self-esteem hurt feelings and decreased self-esteem are the typical, global, immediate reactions to experiencing ostracism (leary & springer, 2001; richman & leary, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"therefore, self-esteem serves as a social monitor, or sociometer, that detects the likelihood of inclusion and helps people regulate their behaviors to remain included (leary, tambor, terdal, & downs, 1995)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"high self-esteem serves as a buffer, protecting against life stressors and facilitating adjustment to life changes (leary et al., 1995)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,threats to self-esteem bring into focus the potential for future instances of ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,this shift in selfesteem prompts behavior that is likely to maintain social connections.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"it is worth noting that targets of virtual ostracism report less of a decline in feelings of selfesteem than targets of face-to-face ostracism (williams et al., 2002)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,why ostracism hurts ostracism is psychologically painful because it threatens the fundamental need to belong and decreases self-esteem.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"from an evolutionary perspective, belonging increases chances of survival and reproduction (baumeister & leary, 1995)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"failure to belong, like other fundamental needs, leads to distress and dysfunction (baumeister & leary, 1995; leary & cox, 2008)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"when the 4 opportunity to participate in these relationships is threatened, people take notice."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"when goals are threatened or blocked, people modify their thoughts, feelings, or behaviors in order to reach their goals (baumeister & dewall, 2004)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"because people are fundamentally social beings, belonging is a goal that drives much of behavior (leary & cox, 2008)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"people seek out friend groups, join clubs, and maintain family relationships to be a part of something beyond themselves."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"individuals control their actions in order to ensure membership and acceptance within their group (baumeister & dewall, 2004; baumeister, dewall, ciarocco, & twenge, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"in fact, people will forgo selfserving desires in order to maintain acceptance within a social group."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"for example, people may agree with group consensus when the decision inconveniences them personally."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"hence, people seem highly motivated to avoid rejection and achieve acceptance (leary & cox, 2008)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,ostracism understood through self-regulation theory effects of ostracism on self-regulation ostracism affects not only psychological well-being but also impairs the ability to self-regulate (see table 1).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"misguided self-regulation leads to self-defeating behavior (azar, 2009; baumeister & dewall, 2004; baumeister, dewall, ciarocco, & twenge, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"for example, self-regulation is needed to maintain a diet or exercise regime and to monitor appropriate behavior in social situations."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"when people are ostracized, they lose the willingness to self-regulate (baumeister et al., 2005; dewall, baumeister, & vohs, 2008)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"ostracism inhibits the cognitive motivation necessary to avoid impulsive acts like choosing an unhealthy snack alternative (baumeister et al., 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,avoiding self-awareness or responding in adaptive or maladaptive ways are attempts at self regulation
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"people self-regulate in order to feel good, or at least to not feel bad about themselves."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,self-control an important component of self-regulation theory affected by ostracism is self-control.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"self-control is a limited resource that, when expended in one domain, can cause self-regulation failures in other domains."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,found that people who forced themselves to eat radishes instead of chocolates gave up sooner on subsequent puzzle tasks.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"this suggests that different acts requiring self-control draw from a single, central resource (baumeister et al., 1998)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,ostracized individuals draw upon self-control when they believe doing so will satiate the need to belong.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"for example, dewall, baumeister, and vohs (2008) found ostracized participants performed better and exerted greater effort on subsequent tasks only when the tasks were presented as indicators of socially attractive traits."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,selfcontrol is also affected when individuals are asked to ostracize others.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"for example, ciarocco, sommer, and baumeister (2001) found decrements in self-control when participants were asked to ostracize another individual through giving them the ""silent treatment."""
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,it appears ostracizing others affects self-control beyond the social domain.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,it is unknown if being the target of ostracism causes similar influences on self-control.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"despite the evidence of the pervasive, negative effects of ostracism on psychological well-being, not everyone reacts in the same way."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"there are individual differences in reactions to stressors (i.e., ostracism), so it follows that certain personality traits may moderate the effects of ostracism on psychological well-being and self-regulatory behaviors."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"three personality traits that seem particularly relevant to ostracism are hope, optimism, and forgiveness because they are theoretically connected to self-regulation within social contexts."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,forgiveness is a personality trait that impacts how people respond to social situations when they are wronged.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"it may be that possessing these traits enables individuals to persist in self-regulatory behaviors that lead to achieving important goals, including social inclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"with this understanding, the successes of social interactions fulfill basic human goals."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"as social interactions are social goals, hope levels may impact how social goals are envisioned and with how much confidence individuals pursue these goals."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"according to hope theory, emotions are the sequelae of an individual's success or failure in making progress toward or reaching goals (snyder, rand, & sigmon, 2002)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,there is evidence that hope may influence people's reactions to ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"hope is associated with greater self-esteem, even under stressful situations."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"for example, college students with higher levels of hope indicated higher levels of energy, confidence, and feel more challenged by their goals than peers with lower levels of hope (snyder et al., 1991)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"as ostracism blocks the goal of belonging, individuals higher in hope may persist through ostracism with greater psychological well-being."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"college students indicating higher levels of hope also reported higher levels of self-worth (snyder, hoza, pelham, & rapoff, 1997)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,snyder and pulvers (2001) posited that individuals higher in hope are better able to handle unforeseen stress and more likely to use effective coping methods.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"individuals with high hope view their hope as a form of protection, which leads to a more positive perspective for the future (snyder, feldman, taylor, schroeder, & adams, 2000)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"from these findings, it is of interest to determine if hope may serve as a moderator for the effects of being ostracized."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"optimism optimism is the belief that good things are generally more likely to happen than bad things (scheier & carver, 1985)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"even when faced with the same situation, the expectancies or beliefs about what is likely to happen in the future impact the level of motivation put forth toward achieving a goal."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"optimists are more likely to expect a favorable outcome and emerge with a sense of greater confidence than those who are pessimistic (carver & scheier, 1998)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,there is evidence that optimism may influence people's reactions to ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"an optimistic attitude appears to enable people to respond to stress effectively (scheier, weintraub, & carver, 1986)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,optimists are more likely to use problem-focused coping when facing stressful situations.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"in comparison to 8 pessimists, optimists tend to use coping strategies that are more adaptive (scheier et al., 1986)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"people who are high in optimism tend to actively seek ways to change and adjust to stressful situations (carver & connor-smith, 2010)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"optimism is also linked with greater self-esteem (wu, tsai, & chen, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"for women with breast cancer, those higher in optimism maintain a positive mood easier and are better protected against possible negative repercussions of cancer treatment (matthews & cook, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,optimism may impact how individuals respond to ostracism as the positive expectancy of good events occurring may buffer the negative effects of ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"from these findings, it is of interest to determine if optimism may moderate the effects of experiencing ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"forgiveness is a combination of thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors that are a responsive choice when someone is wronged."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,the conscious choice to forgive requires the forgiver to forgo the drive of seeking retribution.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"a transgression is understood to be an event that counters expectations about how situations or others should be or behave (thompson et al., 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"when transgressions occur, individuals typically react with negative thoughts toward the transgressor, the situation, and even themselves."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"when choosing to forgive, individuals must engage in the cognitive work necessary to reframe."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"it is psychological work that often manifests behaviorally in how the individual who was transgressed against chooses to respond to the situation, the transgressor, and outcomes of the transgression (thompson et al., 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"as forgiveness is based within social interactions, the tendency to choose forgiveness may protect against the deleterious effects of ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"the paradox of 9 forgiveness - that those who choose to forgive are themselves psychologically benefited (enright, freedman, & rique, 1998) - may inform how individuals respond to encountering ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,it is posited that forgiveness facilitates the recovery from interpersonal offenses.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"anxiety derived from ostracism, such as school bullying, may be alleviated by teaching forgiveness as an emotional coping response (egan & todorov, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,there is evidence that forgiveness may influence people's reactions to ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"those who are likely to forgive are more emotionally stable and agreeable (mccullough, 2001)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"in addition, people high in forgiveness also tend to have greater selfesteem (brown, 2003)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,those who are ostracized are unable to control their situation.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,it may be that those who are high in the personality trait of forgiveness are better able to recover from the effects of ostracism as they are willing to engage in the psychological work necessary to release perceived control and blame.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"from these findings, it is of interest to determine if forgiveness may moderate the effects of experiencing ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,the first purpose is to replicate prior findings which indicate that experiencing ostracism does negatively affect psychological well-being and self-control.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"in addition, it is unknown if personality traits central to self-regulation (i.e., hope and optimism) and social goals (i.e., forgiveness) influence how individuals respond to ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"this study will address two questions: 1) does being ostracized negatively impact psychological well-being (i.e., belonging and selfesteem) and self-control (i.e., cognitive and physical persistence); 2) does hope, optimism, or forgiveness moderate the effects of ostracism on psychological wellbeing and self-control?"
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,hypotheses hypothesis 1 experiencing ostracism will negatively affect psychological well-being.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,this is a replication hypothesis that ostracized individuals will report decreases in psychological well-being as previously indicated by researchers.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"within william's model (1997), sense of belonging and self-esteem are the facets of psychological well-being most directly affected when experiencing ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,control and meaningful existence may be threatened through experiences other than ostracism and are described by richman and leary (2009) as secondary effects.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,giving the silent treatment caused reductions in the persistence on subsequent anagram and handgrip tasks.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,it is unknown if being the target of virtual ostracism results in decreased self-control across domains.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"hypothesis 3 hope, optimism, and forgiveness will moderate the relationship between ostracism and psychological well-being."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"as previously mentioned, these three personality traits appear to be protective when faced with stressful situations."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"it is expected that those higher in hope, optimism, or forgiveness may show less of a decline in reported psychological wellbeing after experiencing ostracism when compared to individuals low in these personality traits hypothesis 4 hope, optimism, and forgiveness will moderate the relationship between ostracism and self-control."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"ostracized individuals higher in hope, optimism, or forgiveness will demonstrate greater self-control."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"persistence on the self-control tasks may be more of a measure of demand characteristics in the desire of the student to be a ""good participant"" and perform in the way they believe the experimenter hopes."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"for example, participants could persist for longer or make more attempts at the tracing task in an attempt to please the experimenter."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,it is also possible that decrements on the performance tasks could be due to other variables besides experiencing ostracism.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,prior exposure to tracing tasks or the novelty of the handgrip may alter findings.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,participation was restricted based on age as participants were at least 18 years of age in order to secure informed consent.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,recruitment occurred through a subject pool generated at iupui in which psychology students may elect to participate in research studies to receive course credit.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"manipulation checks by researchers confirm that individuals in the ostracism condition did indeed feel excluded more so than those intended to be included in the virtual game (chow, tiedens, & govan, 2008; zadro, williams, & richardson, 2004)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"virtual ostracism experienced through cyberball elicited negative effects comparable to real-life social exclusion in interpersonal encounters (zadro, williams, & richardson, 2004)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"consistently, ostracized individuals reported decreased sense 15 of belonging and self-esteem."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"some participants were unable to hold the handgrip in their non-dominate hand as instructed, so they were allowed to complete the task using their dominate hand."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"in the ostracism condition, participants received the ball two times near the beginning of the game, but then were left out for the remaining passes, providing around 3 minutes of ostracism after initial inclusion in the ball-passing activity."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"again, the experimenter was not in the room for this portion of the study as the presence of another person in the room may alter how the participant perceived the experience."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,deception is a necessary element of the design in order to garner true reactions to the inclusion or exclusion experienced.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"to control for order effects, the cognitive and physical self-control tasks were counterbalanced among participants."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"results based on previous research, i predicted that experiencing ostracism would lead to decreases in psychological well-being and self-control."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"in addition, i predicted that hope, optimism, and forgiveness would moderate the relationship between ostracism and psychological well-being and self-control."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,hypothesis 1 is that experiencing ostracism will negatively affect psychological well-being.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,hypothesis 2 is that experiencing ostracism will cause decrements in self-control.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"hypothesis 3 is that the hope, optimism, and forgiveness will moderate the relationship between ostracism and psychological well-being such that those higher in these traits will exhibit less of a decline in well-being than those lower in these traits."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"hypothesis 4 is that hope, optimism, and forgiveness will moderate the relationship between ostracism and selfcontrol such that those higher in these traits will exhibit more self-control than those lower in these traits."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,it is worth noting that the correlation between time on the cognitive task and time on the physical task of self-control are lower than expected if both are measures of self-control (r = .04).
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"due to the influence of gender on performance for the physical self-control task, it is of interest to examine performance for females."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"in partial support for h1, ostracized participants experienced decreases in belonging."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"the latter finding may be due to a range restriction and poor reliability of the single-item measure used to assess momentary self-esteem (devellis, 2003)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"it may be that completing these other items served as a distracter, allowing participants to recover from any temporary detriments in self-esteem due to being ostracized."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"it could also be that ostracized participants intentionally inflated their self-esteem response due to social desirability (chan, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"after completing items germane to the ostracism manipulation, participants may have wished to ""fake good,"" thinking that they were intended to be unaffected by the ball-toss in terms of self-esteem."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"based on current findings, it seems that ostracism affects certain subtypes of psychological well-being but not others (c.f."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,people may not demonstrate immediate declines in self-esteem due to defensive responses meant to maintain their self-esteem levels.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,it may be that the findings of the current study are an accurate reflection of self-esteem levels after ostracized or it may be that my findings were confounded by reasons mentioned previously.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"hypothesis 2 was that ostracized individuals would demonstrate decreases in self-control compared to their included peers, for which i found partial support."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"however, ostracized participants did persist for a shorter amount of time on the cognitive task, which provides partial support for h2."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"this finding replicates the work of baumeister, dewall, ciarocco, and twenge (2005), who found that ostracized participants gave up sooner on tracing tasks."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"while the method of ostracism differed, the finding that ostracized participants persisted for a shorter amount of time on the tracing task remains."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"the current finding also supports the work of ciarocco, sommer, and baumeister (2001) who found that individuals who gave the silent treatment persisted for a shorter amount of time on subsequent anagram tasks."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,this may be due to the novelty of the stimulus.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"although the experimenter demonstrated how to hold the handgrip in the non-dominate hand and how to pick up the ball between the handles, the novelty of the task may have confounded the results."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"participants may not have realized how tightly they would need to squeeze the handles to hold the ball into place, resulting in them dropping the ball prematurely."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"it is reasonable to expect that if the handgrip and tracing tasks were both measuring selfcontrol, they would be at least moderately correlated."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,these participants tended to be those who were surprised that the ball had already fallen from between the handles and would ask if they could complete the task again.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"for some participants (mostly female), it was difficult to grip the handgrip due to the size of their hands."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"as it was difficult for participants to properly set up for this task, it is not likely that the time the participants persisted is an actual measure of self-control."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"based on my findings, measuring self-control by the protocol used in this study leads to undesired measurement error."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"in response to the first study question, difficulty with measurement of the construct of self-control led to inconclusive results."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"while ostracism did impair persistence on the cognitive task, it did not impair persistence on the physical task."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,it may be that ostracism only affects certain subtypes of self-control.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"based on my findings with the tracing task, it appears that ostracism affects the ability to persist at a difficult task, but not the ability to initiate the task."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"it may be that ostracized participants are willing to initiate the task, but they give up sooner than their included peers when they realize the difficulty of the task."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"this would 34 support previous findings in which those ostracized demonstrated lower performance scores as the difficulty of the items increased (baumeister & dewall, 2004)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,this may have decreased measurement error due to the novelty of the stimulus as participants would have used the handgrip before and after the ostracism manipulation.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"no support was found for h3 which predicted that hope, optimism, or forgiveness moderate the relationship between ostracism and psychological wellbeing."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"although previously found to be protective in stressful situations, none of these personality traits were able to buffer the effects of experiencing ostracism."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,part of the difficulty with testing these moderating relationships is that ostracism only affected one of my measures of psychological well-being.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"for example, the unequal sample sizes between my ostracism (n = 47) and inclusion groups (n = 57) is one factor that decreased power in my study."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"in addition, outcome variables without enough response options also decrease power (frazier et al., 2004)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"due to the smaller than desired sample size and additional issues discussed, it is likely that moderating relationships were not detectable because my study is underpowered."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"no support was found for h4, which predicted that hope, optimism, or forgiveness would moderate the relationship between ostracism and self-control."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"for the physical self-control task, men persisted longer as did those who had stronger baseline hand strength."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"as with h3, part of the difficulty with testing these moderating relationships is that ostracism only affected one of the self-control measures."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"as previously discussed, detection of any moderating relationships is hindered in my study because it is underpowered."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"based on these findings, the answer to the second study question is that hope, optimism, or forgiveness do not seem to moderate the relationship between ostracism and psychological well-being or self-control."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"this has led researchers to believe that it may be that the response to being ostracized is so automatic that other variables such as personality traits are too distal to affect the response (williams & nida, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"one group of researchers did find that ostracized participants high in social anxiety experienced the negative effects of ostracism longer (zadro, boland, & richardson, 2006)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"they found that social anxiety did not moderate the relationship between ostracism and psychological well-being directly after the experience, but this relationship did appear when assessed 45 minutes later."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"it may be that moderating effects of hope, optimism, or forgiveness could be detected if assessed at a later time point."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"first, null findings could be reflective of the actual situation, meaning there is no meaningful relationship between study variables."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"second, null findings could be the result of methodological issues that prevent the researcher from observing the real relationship between study variables."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"most likely for this study, type ii error and inadequate power could have influenced the results of this study (kazdin, 2002)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"it is likely that due to my study being underpowered, meaningful differences between groups were not detected (pagano, 2010)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,this would introduce additional variance into the data that could be avoided.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"due to my strict adherence to my protocol, i think it is unlikely that null findings can be attributed to failed protocol and uncontrolled error."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"finally, null findings may also be attributed to differences in measurement between dependent and independent variables (kazdin, 2002)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"it is possible that null findings of this study are due to differences in measurement of variables, but i think that additional factors beyond those highlighted by kazdin are more likely."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"to start, the use of a convenience sample may have influenced study results."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,the use of a college student population resulted in a restricted age range as the average range for this sample was 23 years old.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"as the study was advertised as relating to social interactions and would involve interacting with other students, it is likely that students who do not enjoy interacting with others did not self-select to participate in this study."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,there may be meaningful differences in how ostracism affects those who enjoy and who do not enjoy social interactions in terms of how ostracism affects their well-being and self-control.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,it may also be that findings were affected by demand characteristics of the sample.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"for example, participants may have sensed they should persist longer on the cognitive self-control task as a large stack of transparencies was left on the table."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,this large stack could have served as a cue that the experimenter expected them to persist for a reasonably long period of time.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,it could also be that participants persisted for longer on the self-control tasks in an effort to please the examiner and receive positive feedback.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"prior research indicates that people who are ostracized are motivated to restore social connections once ostracized (richman & limitations 38 leary, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,this positive feedback could serve as an indicator of social acceptance and restore feelings of social connectedness.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"currently, researchers within this field do not use the same scales to measure key dependent variables, which greatly reduces general iz ability of findings."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"it may be that if the same scale used by williams' lab (see williams et al., 2002) was used for this study, there could have been more meaningful and consistent outcomes with prior research."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"without the use of well-validated measures across labs researching ostracism, it is difficult to compare findings."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"i support the use of cyberball as the ostracism manipulation as it enabled me to see if i could replicate prior findings with a different ostracism manipulation, particularly in terms of decrements to selfcontrol."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"to think of my study conceptually, it may have been easier to detect meaningful changes in psychological well-being and self-control if these two dependent variables were assessed in separate studies."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"for participants to first complete the self-report measures before the self-control tasks, this could have depleted self-control before participants reach that portion of the study."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"as selfcontrol is believed to be a limited resource, tapping into that resource prematurely by asking participants to focus on the self-report measures could interfere with detecting meaningful differences in performance on self-control that are based solely on the ostracism manipulation (baumeister, bratslavsky, muraven, & tice, 1998)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"on the other hand, for participants to first complete the self-control tasks eliminates the assessment of any momentary well-being outcomes, which is a central focus of this study."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"i designed the study so that participants did complete the well-being measures 39 first, but it is likely at the expense of finding additional meaningful self-control outcomes."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"as mentioned, even within the well-being items, the momentary selfesteem item should have been first if not entirely replaced by multiple items which would increase the chances of finding meaningful information (devellis, 2003)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,it may be that defenses block declines in self-esteem for single rejection episodes.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"while laboratory manipulations may be less salient in eliciting effects on self-esteem, blackhart et al."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,found that chronic rejection is linked with lower self-esteem.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"in addition, more direct ostracism manipulations (i.e., explicit, face-to-face rejection vs. implicit, rejection priming) demonstrate greater effects on self-esteem (see also poulsen, 2006)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"this later assessment is telling of the duration of the aversive affects of ostracism and this could be a way that hope, optimism, and forgiveness demonstrate a meaningful effect by affecting how people cope instead of their immediate reactions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"in addition, based on the findings of this study, it seems that using cyberball as an ostracism manipulation may be less effective than other manipulations such as face-to-face interactions."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"it may be that using a different method of ostracism, such as the future alone condition, may elicit more salient effects despite the convenience of using such a brief and accessible method like cyberball."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"also, researchers should use caution when using the handgrip task and ensure that issues such as hand size do not interfere with data quality."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"experiencing ostracism is deleterious not only to one's psychological wellbeing, but also has ramifications for self regulation specifically in terms of selfcontrol."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"people are goal-oriented, and the social nature of people creates the goal of belonging, which drives much of behavior (carver & scheier, 1998; leary & cox, 2008)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"the need to belong is so fundamental that emotions provide feedback to inform people that change is needed in order to restore social connections (dewall, baumeister, & vohs, 2008)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,this feedback comes in the form of decreased belonging and self-esteem.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"in order to reach goals and maintain social connections, people selfregulate their behavior (leary & cox, 2008)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"ostracism effects self-regulation negatively in that self-control is diminished after experiencing ostracism (baumeister, dewall, ciarocco, & twenge, 2005)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,conclusions the findings from my study provided partial support for h1 and h2: experiencing ostracism will negatively affect psychological well-being and experiencing ostracism will cause decrements in self-control.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,ostracized participants also persisted for less time on the cognitive self-control task than their included peers.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"no support was found for h3 or h4: hope, optimism, and forgiveness will moderate the relationship between ostracism and psychological well-being and hope, optimism, and forgiveness will moderate the relationship between ostracism and self-control."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"for both of these hypotheses, i posited that those higher in these traits would exhibit less of the expected decline in both psychological well-being and self-control."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"as discussed previously, methodological issues may have contributed to my null findings."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,a larger sample size and equal number of participants in each condition would have increased power which may have altered study findings.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,different measures for momentary self-esteem and self-control may also have altered findings to be consistent with previous research.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"in conclusion, ostracism is a powerful experience that does affect people not only in how they feel about themselves and others, but also in their behavior."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,it may be that ostracism is so powerful that initially these traits are too distal to make an impact.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"given time, there may be individual differences due to these traits that would surface in terms of how people make attributions about their ostracism experience and also how the experience affects their behavior."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf46.pdf,"as it is likely that everyone will encounter ostracism in some form during their life, it is important to understand the impact of ostracism and to explore what can be done to buffer the effects of social exclusion."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"consequently, determining whether a particular interrogation tactic constitutes torture requires an accurate assessment of how much pain the tactic inflicts."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"because policymakers do not subject themselves to interrogation before assessing its permissibility, in evaluating interrogation policies they must predominantly rely on their subjective intuitions about how painful the experience seems."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"this ambiguity in judging torture policy has become particularly acute with the increased use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques,"" such as prolonged sleep deprivation, social isolation, and exposure to cold temperatures, that are intended to induce physical and psychological distress without inflicting enduring harm (wolfendale, 2009)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"because such a tactic produces no physical trace, judging the severity of suffering becomes purely a matter of judging what is going on in the mind of the person on whom the act is performed."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"yet emerging research on the hot-cold empathy gap (loewenstein, 1996) challenges the assumption that people who are not actively experiencing a particular interrogation tactic (and likely never have experienced it) can accurately judge the degree of pain that tactic inflicts."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"the notion of a hot-cold empathy gap captures the idea that people who are not actively experiencing an emotional or visceral state (e.g., pain) generally underestimate that state's motivational force and intensity."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"this discrepancy could result from an overestimation of the pain of torture by people in pain, an underestimation of the pain of torture by those not in pain, or both."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,the fourth experiment shows that the discrepancy results from an underestimation of pain by people who are not experiencing it.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"given that legal standards guiding torture are typically established by people who are not in pain, this research suggests that practices that do constitute torture are likely to not be classified as such."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"for example, the medical literature has consistently reported that physicians underestimate the severity of their patients' pain (kappesser, williams, & prkachin, 2006; marquie et al., 2004; pasero & mccaffery, 2001), and that patients themselves underestimate the severity of the pain that upcoming medical procedures will produce christensen sz alan ski 1984)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"laboratory studies have similarly demonstrated that individuals who are not actively experiencing physical pain dramatically underestimate the severity of both past and future painful events (nordgren, van der pligt, & van harreveld, 2006; read & loewenstein, 1999)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"and a recent study on perceptions of ostracism found that people also experience empathy gaps for psychological pain: people who are not actively feeling socially excluded have great difficulty appreciating the severity of the experience (nordgren, banas, & macdonald, in press)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,we argue that experiencing a small dose of the specific pain produced by an interrogation tactic provides a more realistic understanding of how torture is experienced.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"therefore, judgments of torture that are made in a state of pain are more fully informed, and hence more valid, than those made in the absence of pain."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"although this reasoning is consistent with the literature on pain perception that we have just reviewed, a discrepancy between judgments made by people in pain and those made by people not in pain could also be produced by an overestimation of pain severity by people who are themselves in pain."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"solitary confinement is an aversive experience because people have a fundamental need for social contact and can experience severe distress when this need is unmet (baumeister & leary, 1995)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"and recent research has shown that people experience empathy gaps for psychological pain much as they do for physical pain (nordgren et al., in press)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"on the basis of this evidence, we predicted that participants who were actively experiencing social pain would judge solitary confinement to be more painful and less ethical than would participants who were not experiencing social pain."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"of our predictions, and the results suggest that if participants experienced the full severity of solitary confinement, even fewer would support its practice."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,study 2 tested whether participants' own state of fatigue would influence their assessment of sleep deprivation as a method of interrogation.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,the students taking this course had full-time day jobs and were therefore generally very tired by the end of class.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,we predicted that fatigued participants would rate sleep deprivation based interrogation to be more painful and thus less ethical than would nonfatigued participants.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"we argue that this effect results from the enhanced perspective taking of people experiencing pain, but it is possible that, instead, the arousal itself influences judgment."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"for example, if pain alters mood, this might account for the observed effect."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"if the sleep deprivation manipulation affected judgments of the sleep deprivation based technique as a result of enhanced perspective taking, as we predicted, then we would observe no difference between conditions in evaluations of the cold temperature interrogation."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"cronbach's alpha was .84. we measured sleep deprivation last to avoid cuing awareness of the purpose of the study, thereby minimizing demand effects."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"study 3: exposure to cold temperatures in the first two studies, we found that people who were not actively experiencing pain judged interrogation tactics to be less severe than did participants who were experiencing pain."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"this is a crucial point because during their training, professional interrogators generally undergo mild versions of enhanced interrogation, which may give them better insight into the severity of such practices."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,were actively feeling cold would have reduced tolerance for interrogation tactics that involved subjection to cold temperatures.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"it also helped to rule out demand effects, because participants in this condition and the first condition were both exposed to cold temperatures before making their judgments."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,we predicted that only participants who were actively experiencing cold temperatures would have a heightened appreciation for the severity of cold temperature interrogation.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"experiencing cold temperature just 10 min prior to answering the pain and ethicality questions did not affect participants' evaluations, a finding that underscores the point that people need to actively experience pain in order to appreciate torture's severity."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"study 4: real versus simulated pain in the first three studies, we found that participants who were actively experiencing simulated interrogation pain evaluated interrogation tactics to be more painful and less ethical than did participants who made their judgments while pain free."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,the design we used was based on the assumption that experiencing a small dose of the specific pain produced by an interrogation tactic provides a more realistic and complete understanding of how that tactic is experienced.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"however, such a discrepancy between individuals experiencing and not experiencing pain need not be due to underestimation of pain by those who are not experiencing it (as predicted by the empathy-gap hypothesis); it could also arise if those experiencing pain tend to overestimate the severity of pain produced by torture."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"first, we predicted that participants who held their hand in warm water would rate this form of punishment to be less painful and more ethical compared with participants who were actually experiencing cold weather."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"second, we predicted that participants who held their hand in ice water and those who were actually experiencing cold weather would not differ in their ratings of the punishment's pain severity."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"specifically, during the winter, students who acted out were forced to stand outside in the cold without a jacket on for up to 3 min (but only on days when the temperature did not fall below freezing)."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,discussion legal doctrine specifies that whether a particular interrogation method should be deemed to be torture depends on the severity of pain the tactic produces.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,yet our findings suggest that empathy gaps for physical and psychological pain undermine people's ability to objectively evaluate interrogation practices.
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"in studies 1 through 3, people were more likely to classify a particular interrogation technique as unethical when they themselves were experiencing even a small degree of the particular pain that the technique produces."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"because the people who make torture policy rarely subject themselves to interrogation tactics before assessing their permissibility, our results suggest that such policies are misinformed by a systematic tendency to underestimate the pain produced by interrogation practices."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,"aftermath of highly publicized cases of psychologists providing guidance to individuals who formulated torture policies and tactics, the american psychological association (2010) has banned member psychologists from participating in torture."
/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/Third_dataset/pdf61.pdf,people cannot appreciate the severity of interrogation practices they themselves are not experiencing-a psychological constraint that in effect encourages torture.
